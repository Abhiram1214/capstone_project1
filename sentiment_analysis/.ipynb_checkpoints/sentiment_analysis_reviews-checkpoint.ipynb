      "b'all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . \\nthank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . \\nyour influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . \\nit isn\\'t just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised \" featuring the music of . . . \" no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . \\nwelcome to the club , scott kalvert . \\nyour adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . \\ndicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based . \\nas the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) . \\none night , jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine , and shortly thereafter to heroin . \\njim\\'s addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school . \\nalong with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower . \\nthe basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . \\nscreenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll\\'s posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends . \\nas a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long \" just say no \" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . \\njim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out . \\nperhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those \" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd \" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . \\nwithout a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . \\ndirector scott kalvert doesn\\'t have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . \\non only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective . \\nmostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . \\nthey also don\\'t allow leonardo dicaprio\\'s performance to be as strong as it could have been . \\nfor every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . \\ndicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won\\'t let character interaction define this story . \\nhe wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting . \\nat isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio\\'s talents . \\nfar more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . \\n'\n",

      "b' \" the endurance : shackleton\\'s legendary antarctic expedition \" \\nin 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot . \\n28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years . \\ndirector george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in \" the endurance : shackleton\\'s legendary antarctic expedition . \" \\nthe expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica . \\nas the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land . \\nfor months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety . \\nshackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island . \\nonce on this \" safe \" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization . \\nhe and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world\\'s roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia . \\nmiraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours . \\nthis ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen . \\nin the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war . \\nthe title of this fascinating documentary , \" the endurance , \" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world . \\nit is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth . \\nthe name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather . \\nit also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men . \\nwith astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey . \\nthe filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow . \\nafter the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on . \\nconsidering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world\\'s harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself . \\n ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , \" south , \" an interesting companion piece for \" the endurance . \" \\nif shackleton\\'s original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat . \\nas you watch the story of \" the endurance \" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent . \\n ( shackleton\\'s amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . ) \\nthere are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though . \\nactor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale . \\nthe nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary\\'s first half . \\nas the crew\\'s adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events . \\nhelmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of \" the endurance , \" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition . \\ni can\\'t think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds . \\n \" the endurance , \" based on caroline alexander\\'s book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where

      "b'it is simply amazing how \" the green mile \" developed in its three hour running time . \\nbased on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . \\nhowever , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . \\nfrank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner\\'s story in \" the shawshank redemption \" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . \\nthrough edgecomb\\'s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . \\nfrom an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , \" the green mile \" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . \\nthe plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . \\nthe performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . \\nthe ensemble acting in the film is perfect . \\nhanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . \\nthey are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . \\nthey are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . \\nthe more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . \\nsome particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . \\nhutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . \\nevery time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . \\nit would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . \\nrockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . \\nas a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . \\nthis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . \\nthe last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . \\nduncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . \\nhis desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . \\nhis pain creates pain for the viewer . \\nhowever , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . \\nthe film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at \" the jerry springer show . \" \\nthe scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . \\nnot only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . \\nas the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . \\nhis death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . \\ngreene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don\\'t even see him walk the infamous green mile . \\nhowever , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . \\nthe speed in \" the green mile \" is perfect . \\nif time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . \\nthe three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . \\n \" the green mile \" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . \\nfighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . \\nif you survive the first third of \" the green mile \" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment . \\n'\n",

      "b'scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption . \\nal pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami . \\noliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles . \\nthe film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states . \\nmany of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime . \\nnearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry . \\nalong with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field . \\ntony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank\\'s lover . \\nof course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force . \\nthis is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami . \\ntony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone , and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him . \\nno one can trust him , and basically , no one does . \\nscarface , although incredibly violent , is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino . \\nalthough he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance , it truly is a very good one . \\nin fact , his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination ( although he did get a golden globe nomination ) . \\nanother element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity . \\na figure tagged to the film boasts that the word \" fuck \" and it\\'s uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film , which is apparently a record . \\nthe thing is , the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie . \\nas odd as it sounds , it\\'s true . \\nin the end , scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard . \\n'\n",
      "b'there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of \" scream queen \" in the early \\'80s . \\ntwo of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween . \\nthe same \" god , i\\'m scared , there\\'s some guy in a mask coming after me \" routine she did in john carpenter\\'s classic , jamie lee copies here , with none of the urgency or suspense . \\nterror train takes place on ( where else ? ) a train , charted by some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher education . \\nmost of them won\\'t make it to med school , though , and it\\'s obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , \" i wish to hell they\\'d put a radio on that train . \" \\nthe conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee . \\nfrom the beginning , he\\'s talking his head off ( he tells one of his co-workers \" think on this -- when\\'s the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? \" \\nas if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles . \\nof course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it . \\ni forgot to mention the prologue . \\nit\\'s a party three years earlier , with the same group of students . \\ntwo of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he\\'s going to get laid . \\nthey send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed . \\nshe says , \" kiss me , kenny , \" and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver . \\n ( \" oh my god , they killed kenny ! \\nyou bastards ! \" ) \\nit\\'s a sick trick , and one jamie lee wasn\\'t let in on . \\nshe still hasn\\'t forgiven the guy as they board the terror train ( \" you asshole , you can\\'t have a good time without hurting somebody ! \" ) . \\nthe killing starts before the train even leaves the station . \\nsince it\\'s new year\\'s , everyone\\'s wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we\\'ve seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one\\'s looking . \\nat least one of the characters says it\\'s a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie . \\nspeaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train\\'s most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield \" as the magician , \" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music . \\nthen there\\'s his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that . \\nfor all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing really worth watching . \\nonly die-hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it . \\nand it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse . \\ni mean , when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station , anyway ? \\nterror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car . \\n'\n",
      "b'the great actor james woods once said ( and i\\'m paraphrasing ) , \" if sex isn\\'t messy , then you\\'re not doing it right \" . \\na truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace \" sex \" with \" your mad slasher film \" ) . \\nfor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . \\nurban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . \\nfor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) \" if you can\\'t scare your audience , gross em\\' out , if you can\\'t do that , make em\\' laugh \" . \\nalas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . \\ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . \\nit seems that audiences\\' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . \\nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . \\nunfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don\\'t need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . \\nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . \\nbut forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . \\nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . \\nthese flicks aren\\'t harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? \\nsadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . \\nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . \\ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . \\nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend\\'s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . \\nyou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . \\nall those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . \\nall the better for that elusive crazed killer . \\ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . \\nbut alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it\\'s way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . \\nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . \\nit\\'s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . \\nit\\'s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . \\ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . \\nyes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn\\'t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . \\ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . \\napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . \\nin scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man\\'s rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . \\nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . \\nthough i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . \\nthe film\\'s killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they\\'re coming from inside the house ) . \\ni won\\'t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . \\nsad to say , it doesn\\'t include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . \\nnow that would be scary . \\nbefore i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i\\'ve ever spent an evening with . \\nonly jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . \\nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . \\nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . \\nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can\\'t stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can\\'t stand not getting slaughtered . \\n'\n",

&nbsp ; \\nwhy bring in \" the lone gunmen , \" three computer geek conspiracy theorists , for an even briefer appearance ? &nbsp ; \\nthese characters are recurrent on the series , and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience ( suggesting their popularity among fans - actually most of the audience could pass for \" the lone gunmen \" ) . &nbsp ; \\nstill , then they vanish just as quickly . \\n&nbsp ; 2 . &nbsp ; \\nthe television show never gives us any answers . &nbsp ; \\nwill the movie actually explain some things ?

      "b'pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is \" sex \" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . \\nbecause of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of \" sex \" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \\\\ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it\\'s most likely just another way of referring to \" sex \" . \\ni think we\\'d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . \\nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . \\nbody shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you\\'d normally expect to see a violent attack . \\nit\\'s about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . \\nthese are things we all do , sometimes . \\nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . \\ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . \\nit\\'s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . \\nat its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . \\nmichael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . \\nhis characters don\\'t communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . \\nthey voice simplistic platitudes like \" i like to come \" or \" sex without love equals violence \" . \\nhuh ? \\nand yes that is as complex as this movie\\'s observations get . \\nthe characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . \\nthe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . \\nwe meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . \\ni would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . \\ni\\'m not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . \\nwith the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . \\ni vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( \" sex without love equals violence \" ) . \\nin between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . \\nthe fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . \\nthis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . \\nif body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don\\'t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . \\nadditionally that one side isn\\'t even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . \\nor realism . \\none sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . \\nthey suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn\\'t it erotic , it isn\\'t real . \\nit doesn\\'t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . \\nevery f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . \\nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . \\nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . \\nthe resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \\nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \\nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \\nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can\\'t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\\'s next to wall street . \\nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \\npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \\nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \\nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \\nhe gave them heart . \\ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \\nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \\nthis is not the way to get any message across . \\nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin\\' skins ? \\ncristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation . \\n'\n",
      "b'the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn\\'t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . \\nthe \" hook \" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . \\nhowever , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . \\nthose expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . \\nmercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . \\nthe script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . \\ni don\\'t know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . \\nonce again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . \\nwhile bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . \\nthe story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . \\nunable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . \\nthe event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . \\nsoon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . \\nalong the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . \\nwhy is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? \\napparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called \" mercury . \" \\nto make sure it can\\'t be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a \" nerds\\' puzzle magazine . \" \\nof course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . \\nwhen he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . \\nas a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . \\nbut he hasn\\'t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . \\nit\\'s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn\\'t do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . \\nfor those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren\\'t that pulse-pounding . \\nthe climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . \\noverall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn\\'t derivative or obligatory . \\nbruce willis\\' star seems to be fading . \\nthis is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . \\nwillis isn\\'t terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . \\nalec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . \\nthe film\\'s real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp\\'s son in wes craven\\'s new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . \\nmercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . \\nfor those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . \\nhopefully , the advent of summer will change that . \\nuntil then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . \\nand , if you\\'re determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may . \\n'\n",

      "b'leonardo decaprio ( what\\'s eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv\\'s my so called life ) star in director baz luhrmann\\'s modernized version of william shakespeare\\'s classic , romeo & juliet . \\nsurrounded by a superb supporting cast , in-cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus-pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danes shine throughout the film . \\nthe story starts off at a gas station , where the \" montague boys \" meet the \" capulet boys \" and square off with one another . \\nsymbolizing the swords of shakespeare\\'s day were their weapons , like the \" rapier-9mm \" or the \" longsword- shotgun . \" \\ninstead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old . \\nanother great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo\\'s best friend . \\nmercutio , who in shakespeare\\'s novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri-can-american cross-dresser whose violent na-ture , was a definite plus . \\nmiriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet\\'s nurse , even though she was never given a name . \\nshe was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world . \\nverona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare\\'s version , only slightly changed in luhrmann\\'s . \\nnow known as verona beach , the capulet\\'s ( led by sorvino ) and montague\\'s ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties . \\nand their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars . \\none slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english . \\nsub-titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand . \\nthis excellent movie poses another prob-lem : what genre is it ? \\nromeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories . \\nwith the same award-winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , romeo & juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece . \\n , \\n'\n",
      "b'the event of events is upon us . \\npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \\ni don\\'t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \\nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \\nanyone who tells you \" it\\'s just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \\nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \\nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \\nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \\nin fact , it is terrific . \\ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \\nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \\nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \\nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \\nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \\non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie\\'s real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \\nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \\nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \\n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor\\'s movie . \\naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \\ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \\nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \\nhe\\'s essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \\nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \\nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \\nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \\nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn\\'t already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \\nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \\neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \\nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \\nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \\nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you\\'ll feel a tingle even if you didn\\'t see the movie when it first came out in \\'77 . \\nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \\nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \\nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we\\'re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \\nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \\nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n'\n",

hollywood filter , just so the many won\\'t bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . \\nbut the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . \\nit\\'s rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who\\'s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he\\'s manipulative and he always wins . \\nit wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . \\nwe see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don\\'t fully believe it . \\nand i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film\\'s conclusion that of incompleteness . \\nin the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . \\nin short , he\\'s full of bullshit and we know it . \\nin the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . \\npoint one , it\\'s not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren\\'t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . \\npoint two , it has been through several lawyers . \\nafter turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town\\'s company . \\nthey spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in \" wilde , \" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . \\nthey also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . \\nas we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . \\nthings begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . \\nas macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , \" fargo \" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . \\nin fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i \\nsuppose like a grisham novel ) . \\nthis wouldn\\'t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he\\'s seen as being still full of bullshit . \\nbecause he doesn\\'t take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . \\nthe final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian\\'s mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he\\'s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he\\'s not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film\\'s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . \\nthe fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it\\'s still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . \\nwe need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . \\nit only feels like half of that . \\nmaybe even less . \\nand it\\'s not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . \\nup to then , though , it\\'s an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . \\nthe reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it\\'s about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . \\nwe learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can\\'t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . \\nand duvall\\'s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it\\'s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . \\nfacher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . \\nbut look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it\\'s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . \\nthat\\'s why i liked this film : it\\'s hard to put a pointer on . \\nyou can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren\\'t sure what to make of it . \\ncall it the zallian effect . \\nsame thing happened with \" schindler\\'s list \" ( not that i\\'m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . \\neach film is so greatly crafted that you can\\'t help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . \\nif only it felt totally complete ( like , say , \" schindler\\'s list , \" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . \\n'\n",
      "b\"filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . \\ndoug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . \\nin his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director . \\nbut he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . \\nhis movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . \\nconsistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . \\nthe thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . \\nin story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . \\nneither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . \\n ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) \\nthe early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to . \\nthe characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles . \\nin fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success . \\nalthough that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . \\ngo doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it . \\nas far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme . \\n ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . ) \\nat times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night . \\n\"\n",

      "b'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \\nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \\nthe film is based upon the comic book series \" the flaming carrot \" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \\nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \\nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \\nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \\nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \\n \" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \\nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \\nthat is until they aquire \" invisible boy \" ( kel mitchell ) , and \" the bowler \" ( janeane garafalo ) and \" mr . splein \" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \\nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \\nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \\nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \\nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \\na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \\nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \\nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \\none was paul reuben . \\nno matter how disgusting or revolting \" mr . splein \" may be , you still can\\'t help but laugh . \\nit\\' so incredibly moronic , it\\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \\njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \\nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \\nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \\non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \\nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \\ntheir parts were so limited , they\\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \\nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \\nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \\nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \\nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \\nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \\nit forgets about money making , because it\\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\\'s proceeders , and that\\'s what works . \\nstupid ? \\nmaybe , but for once i\\'m not disappointed . \\nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \\n'\n",
      "b'if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . \\nalthough some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle\\'s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \\nuntil that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \\ncontemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \\none of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin\\'s to live and die in l . a . \\nthe money isn\\'t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \\nrick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \\nrichard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \\nhowever , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . \\nfinally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . \\nbeing frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . \\ntheir plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . \\nlike french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin\\'s movie was inspired by real life . \\ngerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . \\nthat turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \\nsecret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie\\'s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan\\'s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \\nultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \\nwillem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn\\'t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \\ncompared with him , and all the other side characters that want their \" piece of the action \" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . \\ninstead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those \" better judgement \" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . \\nin such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn\\'t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . \\nthe dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin\\'s directing skills . \\nthe tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \\nthat scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . \\nthe soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band \" wang chung \" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . \\nin every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . \\n'\n",
      "b'ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . \\nbruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . \\nthe results shown on screen are amazing considering the film\\'s tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . \\nfollowed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . \\nthe dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it\\'s original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . \\nthe disc contains two versions of the film\\'s audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . \\nincluded are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film\\'s star , bruce campbell . \\ncampbell\\'s commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . \\nsuch informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it\\'s title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . \\nalso , there\\'s a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they\\'ve found that\\'s explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . \\nfor that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . \\nalmost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor\\'s had never smoked before , and as a result they became \" confused \" and were unable to perform the scene . \\ni wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . \\nthe two people you\\'d think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong here , when they do speak it\\'s entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . \\nsometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask \" have anything to say sam ? \" \\nto me , that\\'s not a good sign . \\nalso , it seems like sam raimi doesn\\'t remember much about the film and it\\'s production . . . \\nwell , compared to rob and bruce anyway . \\nalso included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film\\'s \" gala \" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . \\nthis raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . \\noverall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it\\'s genre . \\nand the collector\\'s edition dvd release is well worth your time if you\\'re either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . \\nall special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining . \\n'\n",

      "b\"bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one . \\nthe screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner . \\nanyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration . \\nthe central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one . \\nbobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so . \\na new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye . \\nafter confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie . \\nbut first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project . \\nkit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . \\nafter emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge . \\nthe actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage . \\nthe unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him . \\nwhen the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes . \\nthese include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . \\nbowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen . \\ncertain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny . \\nno , hilarious . \\nstandouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) . \\nand just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas . \\nwhile the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . \\nmasterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script . \\nhowever , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy . \\nthis is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's . \\nmurphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . \\nthese three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . \\nsteve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it . \\nthis is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules . \\nbut it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season . \\nthe supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits . \\nthe only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top . \\ngraham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay . \\ni wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough . \\n\"\n",
      "b'the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from \" l . a . confidential \" to \" palmetto \" to \" the big lebowski , \" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . \\nwith this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . \\n \" wild things \" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol\\' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn\\'t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . \\noveracted , overwrought and overlong , \" wild things \" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . \\nwith its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . \\nin spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , \" wild things \" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there\\'s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . \\ndirected by john mcnaughton ( \" henry : portrait of a serial killer \" ) , \" wild things \" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who\\'s the dream of every spruced up female in the community . \\nparticularly one . \\nkelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . \\nsoon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . \\nnext thing , she cries rape . \\nand the so-called \" roller-coaster ride \" ensues . \\na second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin\\' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . \\neven bill murray gets into the act as lombardo\\'s zany lawyer . \\nhe wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . \\nyou can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . \\nas ridiculous as it sounds , he\\'s the most sane character in the movie . \\nthe community is astonished . \\nreporters flee to the scene . \\nthere\\'s an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly\\'s mother ( theresa russell ) . \\nthere\\'s the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . \\nwe , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . \\nlike so many thrillers these days , including \" the usual suspects \" and \" the game , \" \" wild things \" eschews character for plot . \\nmcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he\\'s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany \" henry , \" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . \\ngeorge clinton\\'s score is a delight to behold . \\nbut it\\'s the humans . \\nthe characters are mere devices for the \" nasty \" twists . \\nwhat writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don\\'t feel real or we don\\'t care for them . \\nnot even the unintentionally funny moments work . \\nthe people in \" wild things \" are not so much people as they are caricatures . \\nthen there\\'s the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . \\nand in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon\\'s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . \\nironically , the wildest elements of \" wild things \" are not wild at all . \\n'\n",
      "b\"i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . \\nfor the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . \\ni found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . \\nas a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . \\nit reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . \\nit's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing . \\nunfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . \\nthe biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . \\nbut it sure is a fascinating failure . \\nmarky . \\n . \\n . \\ner , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . \\nhe's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . \\nhe works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . \\nthey're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . \\nthey all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . \\nit is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . \\nthey decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . \\nwhen they do this , it turns out she is paris' . \\n . \\n . \\ngoddaughter ! \\nit's very bad to have paris against you . \\nthe story is standard action film stuff . \\nit's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . \\nclearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . \\nit's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . \\nthere are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . \\nthey use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . \\nmelvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . \\nlike i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't . \\nwhat makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness . \\nit seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . \\nthen , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . \\nthen , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . \\nkeiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . \\nand scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . \\none of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . \\nthe scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny . \\nand since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . \\nthis is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . \\ncars land on tree branches and are supported by them . \\ncharacters betray each other without a second thought . \\ngrenades are thrown in tight places . \\npeople jump out of tall buildings and survive . \\npeople outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . \\nmost frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . \\nthey're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) . \\nthe characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch . \\nthe acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . \\nphillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed . \\nthe big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . \\nthe funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners . \\nit's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . \\ndespite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . \\nyou can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . \\nif you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself . \\n\"\n",

      "b'1992\\'s alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979\\'s alien and 1986\\'s aliens , savaged david fincher\\'s slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \\nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \\ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \\nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \\nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \\nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \\nwhat could be next ? \\nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also \" infected \" with alien dna . \\nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \\nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection\\'s clever streak in writing stops . \\nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \\nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \\nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \\nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \\nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \\nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \\nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \\nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \\nas technically adept as jeunet\\'s direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon\\'s ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \\na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \\nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott\\'s alien or the even greater film that james cameron\\'s aliens was . \\nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher\\'s alien3 , jeunet\\'s resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \\nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \\n'\n",

muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \\nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \\nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \\nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \\ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \\nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ;

political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \\none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \\nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \\nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \\nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \\nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \\nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \\na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \\nanother man is murdered . \\nthe group of friends will not meet again . \\nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \\nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \\nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \\nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \\ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \\nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \\nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \\ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \\nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \\nthe story earth tells does not end . \\nit just stops . \\nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \\nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \\nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \\nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \\nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \\nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \\nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \\nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \\nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \\nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \\nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \\nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \\nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \\nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ;

      "b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nit\\'s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor\\'s first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup . \\nany hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film\\'s latter half . \\nthe film\\'s central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill . \\nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide . \\nnick casually asks for terry\\'s wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills . \\nof course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch . \\nlearning of nick\\'s condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry\\'s compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick\\'s lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry\\'s death wish by killing him . \\nthis is a promising premise , and mr . taylor\\'s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character . \\nthis is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux . \\nhowever , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable . \\nunfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film\\'s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits . \\nfar from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond . \\nmr . taylor\\'s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as \" you should have asked something more interesting , like \\'do you enjoy the pain ?

      "b'118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language ) \\nmamoru oshii is a name that probably isn\\'t very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be . \\noshii was the director of last year\\'s best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . \\none of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . \\nin its many incarnations--graphic novels ( \" manga \" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . \\nset in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . \\nas a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . \\nas the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as \" labors \" ( an interesting play on words , considering that \" robot \" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . \\nwith the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime . \\nthis led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . \\nthe patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . \\nsometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . \\nthose who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . \\nthe story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . \\nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . \\nhowever , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . . \\nshinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors\\' movement speed and efficiency by 30% . \\nthis hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation\\'s labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 . \\nsince that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . \\n ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) \\nit\\'s up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2\\'s own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father\\'s company down with it . \\nas was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you . \\n_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . \\nit is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) . \\nthere are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ . \\nthis movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . \\npatlabor\\'s near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . \\nthe film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? \\nare history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? \\nthis is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor\\'s alternate-1999 setting . \\nas far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that\\'s the only one i\\'ve seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . \\nthe animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . \\nthe oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . \\nas far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . \\ni don\\'t think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . \\nthe cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters\\' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . \\nthe audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . \\neven without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . \\ngiant robot footsteps are deep and booming . \\nthe sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . \\nas far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they\\'re among the most easily-readable subtitles i\\'ve ever seen for _anything_ . \\nlarge enough that they don\\'t strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . \\nalthough it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . \\nalthough it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people\\'s enjoyment . \\nmy . \\n'\n",

      "b\"the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold . \\nplaced in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white . \\njust what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . \\nas with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . \\na car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . \\nalong the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . \\nin brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . \\nthere is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . \\nremarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . \\neven more remarkably , it works . \\nthe only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity . \\nwith every good film the audience gains new knowledge . \\nhere you learn _two_ things . \\neveryone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy . \\nand don't do violent illegal business with low-life amoral degenerate scum-sucking losers . \\noh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy . \\n\"\n",
      "b'plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side . \\nbut this new guy is not like all the others , he\\'s got ambition , he\\'s got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . \\nviolence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue . \\ncritique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the \" great \" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending . \\nhere\\'s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . \\nokay , so it\\'s not entirely new , but it\\'s definitely original when all put together as done here . \\nthe thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . \\nit\\'s 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! \\nyes , it\\'s all about the suits , fellas . . . the \\nitalian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that\\'s ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . \\nhere are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . \\nbut that\\'s not the basis of this movie . \\nthe basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other . \\nyou know how there are always these \" hanger-on \" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? \\nwell , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that \\nis , their boss . \\nso all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . \\nbut this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . \\nof course , director paul mcguigan isn\\'t trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn\\'t over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . \\nnope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . \\nthe first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he\\'s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! \\n ( \" look into my eyes ! \" ) \\nin fact , the last time that i\\'ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers\\' miller\\'s crossing . \\nscary shite . \\nbut there\\'s an ever better scene than that in this film . \\nthis one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man\\'s point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that\\'s right , he \" does \" the guy in his underwear ) . \\nthat scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . \\nbut the flick\\'s not perfect . \\nin fact , i didn\\'t mind malcolm mcdowell\\'s voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . \\nall he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( \" . . . so \\ni opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . \" -it\\'s \\nlike , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! \\noverdone . ) . \\ni also didn\\'t quite \" buy \" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it\\'s supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? \\ni mean , c\\'mon . . . it\\'s 30 years , man ! ! \\ni don\\'t know , somehow it didn\\'t work all that well for me . \\nbut one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot . \\nforget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell\\'s narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film\\'s stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis . \\nincidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it\\'s the real deal ! \\nnote : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time . \\nit\\'s also quite violent and i don\\'t remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . . \\n ; ) \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ?

      "b'seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o\\'shea for $5 . \\n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \\nthe big-budget , mega-hype \" event \" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . \\ngluttony is hollywood\\'s favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . \\n \" lost in space \" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . \\nit\\'s made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . \\naudiences\\' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has \" star wars \" written all over it ) , but as the producers\\' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . \\nbattle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it\\'s impossible to care about anything that happens . \\nin essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . \\nwe meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth\\'s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . \\neach member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . \\nprofessor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it\\'s obvious what role this aspect will play ) . \\nof course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are \" resolved \" at the right moments . \\nthe only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it\\'s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it\\'s laughable . \\nthe first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . \\nwe\\'re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . \\nin fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . \\nyes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . \\nthey say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it\\'s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . \\nit\\'s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . \\neventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . \\nthe story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . \\nwhat ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . \\nthe first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as \" alien \" -lite . \\nthe story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . \\nbut there\\'s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . \\nplotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . \\nthe atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it\\'s presented in such a ridiculous way it\\'s utterly boring . \\nby the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . \\nthe ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . \\n \" lost in space \" is major film production at its worst . \\nit\\'s frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . \\n'\n",
      "b' \" love is the devil \" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist\\'s psyche rather than the artist\\'s lifeline . \\nwatching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . \\neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film\\'s subject , looked at it personally . \\nbut while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what\\'s going on . \\nexactly what was i looking at ? \\nwatching this film , i wasn\\'t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . \\ndirected ( and written ) by john maybury , \" love is the devil \" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . \\neverything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . \\nthe camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . \\nthe editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon\\'s world and psyche . \\nas such , there is no real story . \\ni\\'ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn\\'t read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . \\nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . \\nas played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he\\'s like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . \\nhe lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . \\nit\\'s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( \" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , \" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \\n \" love is the devil \" chronicles the latter part of his life . \\nbacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . \\nhe walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . \\nbacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . \\ngeorge agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . \\nthe film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . \\nwhile creating bacon\\'s world of friends ( like \" high art , \" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . \\nbacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn\\'t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . \\nwhile watching this , that\\'s basically all i thought was there . \\nthe film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . \\nonce the film is over , it\\'s easier to piece it together . \\ni kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . \\nsomeone doesn\\'t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . \\nthinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . \\ni thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer\\'s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein\\'s \" battleship potemkin \" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . \\nhe drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn\\'t for george . \\ni guess that explains the title . \\na bit . \\nthat\\'s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . \\ni wish it hadn\\'t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . \\nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man\\'s twisted pysche . \\nit\\'s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man\\'s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience\\'s throat . \\nthat way you don\\'t reduce your film to something it\\'s just not . \\ni can\\'t say i totally enjoyed \" love is the devil , \" though . \\ndespite all of the things i respect about this movie , it\\'s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . \\neven at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . \\nthough hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man\\'s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . \\nas such , i respect the way the film looks . \\nit\\'s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with \" what dreams may come \" and \" dark city , \" it\\'s the year\\'s most visually stunning film . \\nin fact , if a better script had been forged , i\\'d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . \\nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . \\ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . \\nthen i would have had something to hold me over even now . \\n'\n",

\\ndepends on whom you ask . \\nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \\nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \\nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \\nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \\n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \\nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \\nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \\nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \\nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \\npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \\nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \\nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \\nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \\noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \\ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \\nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \\nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \\nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \\nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \\nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \\nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \\nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \\nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \\nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \\naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \\nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \\nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \\nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \\nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \\nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \\nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \\ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \\ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \\ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \\nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \\nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \\nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \\nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \\nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \\nyou be the judge . \\nbut back to the picture at hand . \\nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \\nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \\nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \\nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \\nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \\nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \\nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \\n\"\n",

      "b'insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \\nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \\nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute\\' indians that doesn\\'t seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \\nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \\nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \\napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \\nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \\nthe aforementioned `ute\\' indian tribe that packer\\'s group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \\nstone\\'s humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt\\' or revealing what\\'s underneath his muff cap . \\njason mchugh\\'s character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \\nas i mentioned before , parker\\'s songs are very catchy . \\nyou\\'ll be hard pressed to get `it\\'s a shpadoinkle day\\' out of your head once you\\'ve heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \\nother songs you\\'ll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you\\' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper\\'s song\\' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard\\' ( the rousing finale ) . \\nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut\\'s songs are . \\nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \\nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \\nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \\nas for the dvd . . . \\nwell , that\\'s a different story . \\nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \\nthe musical ! \\nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \\npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \\nspecific extras . \\nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i\\'ve ever seen on any disc . \\nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \\nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven\\'t scratched the surface of the extras . \\nthere\\'s also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \\nit\\'s good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . \\nkudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time . \\n'\n",
      "b\"among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s , woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade . \\nthose who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \\nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \\nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \\nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \\none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \\nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \\nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \\nunfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \\nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \\nthe actors that play them don't help either . \\nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \\nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \\nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \\n\"\n",
      "b'everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) . \\nbut piller\\'s not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection\\'s failure . \\ni\\'m about to give the same advice to rick berman and co . \\nas i\\'ve given to the financiers of james bond movies : it\\'s time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director . \\n ( while we\\'re at it , put that visor back on laforge ! ) \\nfor three hundred years , the ba\\'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth . \\nsix hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly . \\nbut evil ru\\'afo ( this is probably abraham\\'s last stop before performing \" amadeus \" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son\\'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba\\'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed . \\nthe federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race . \\n ( never mind that the ba\\'ku didn\\'t exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . ) \\nevery time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment . \\nhe has called it a comedy , a thinking man\\'s picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western . \\n ( i presume that\\'s some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . ) \\nhe has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version . \\nthat\\'s no excuse-someone generated this footage . \\nmuddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia . \\nconsider such curiosities . . . \\npicard\\'s love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ?

      "b'shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \\nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \\nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \\nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \\nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \\nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \\nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \\nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" \\nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \\nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \\nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer\\'s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \\nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate\\'s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can\\'t seem to put words to paper . \\nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer\\'s block . \\nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \\nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it\\'s author . \\nironically , that couldn\\'t be truer here . \\nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \\none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \\nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character\\'s name in the credits . \\nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth\\'s theatres . \\njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \\nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \\ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \\nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \\ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \\nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \\nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn\\'t qualify as real acting . ) . \\nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \\nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \\nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \\nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn\\'t necessarily quality . \\nand this certainly isn\\'t quality . \\nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \\nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \\n'\n",

s . \\nalong the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own . \\nthe film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her \" foxy \" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise . \\nliz is everyone\\'s favorite because she\\'s both beautiful and kind . \\nliz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning . \\nin order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her . \\nthey then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney\\'s car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz\\'s dead body ) . \\ncourtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her . \\nthings get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to . \\nin order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into \" vylette \" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students . \\nup until about this point the film is effective enough . \\nhowever , an investigation begins into liz\\'s death and the film becomes excessively dull . \\nthe recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch . \\ncourtney\\'s plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second . \\nmeanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot . \\njulie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) . \\nhe apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid . \\nfern\\'s rise to popularity is equally lame . \\nwe do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section . \\nit\\'s a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school\\'s resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him . \\nit at least provides us with a look at courtney\\'s personality but the way the scene finishes doesn\\'t make any sense . \\nstein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting . \\nwilliam katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz\\'s distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie\\'s creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman . \\nat times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema\\'s greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer . \\nthe only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look . \\nthe costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid . \\nthey were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color . \\ndirector of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve\\'s bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well . \\nshot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive . \\nperformances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty . \\nnone of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader . \\nthe male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like \" auto stud , \" \" college stud , \" and \" high school stud #2 . \" \\nthe soundtrack is decent and imperial teen\\'s catchy \" yoo hoo \" makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film . \\n'\n",
      "b'i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . \\ni bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , \" it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . \\nthrow in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! \\nwe\\'ll have a hit on our hands ! \" \\nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . \\nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players\\' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . \\nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . \\ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . \\nrounding out the cast includes swingers\\' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . \\nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny\\'s . \\nthe usual things happen like clockwork . \\nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . \\nit\\'s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . \\nhoward deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of \\'80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . \\nobviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . \\nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . \\nthe replacements offers none of this . \\n'\n",
      "b'i\\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \\ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \\nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\\'t do that . \\nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\\'t quite do that either . \\na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\\'s \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\\'t do that . \\nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \\nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \\nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \\nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \\nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \\nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \\nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \\nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \\nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \\nstill , even with the cia\\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \\nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \\nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \\nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \\nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \\nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \\nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \\nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \\nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \\nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \\ni think it\\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \\nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \\nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\\'t even real ? \\nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \\n'\n",
      "b'it\\'s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who\\'s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , \" american history x \" does it , and for that , i commend it . \\nit not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who\\'s not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . \\nthe subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . \\nhe\\'s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \\nhe\\'s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \\nhis name is derek vinyard , and he\\'s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he\\'s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he\\'s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he\\'s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn\\'t need them . \\nhe so believes in his convictions that he\\'s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \\n \" american history x \" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \\nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he\\'s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \\nor at least , that\\'s the intention . \\nthe film\\'s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek\\'s deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . \\nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek\\'s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \\ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he\\'s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \\nhe\\'s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he\\'s wisened up . \\nhe\\'s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who\\'s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \\nbut danny won\\'t . \\nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \\nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \\nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \\nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \\nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \\n \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \\nin it , there are some of the best scenes i\\'ve seen all year . \\none scene features a dinner between derek\\'s family , and his mother\\'s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek\\'s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould\\'s reaction to derek\\'s final summation is unnerrving ) . \\nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \\nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \\nthere\\'s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d\\'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he\\'s given in what seems like a really long time ) . \\nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \\nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \\nthere\\'s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \\nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \\nsadly enough , this isn\\'t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \\nit\\'s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \\nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \\nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn\\'t as well travelled . \\nfurlong\\'s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn\\'t seem like it has actually arrived there . \\neven derek\\'s descent into skinhead-dom doesn\\'t seem justified . \\nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don\\'t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \\nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \\nsorta . \\n \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \\nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \\nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn\\'t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that\\'s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \\nkaye\\'s right in that it\\'s not up to par , even if he\\'s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \\nthis will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . \\nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one\\'s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \\nand even if it isn\\'t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he\\'s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \\n'\n",
      "b'hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . \\nit\\'s a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . \\ni mean , come on . \\nare people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? \\nhell no . \\nand not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . \\nand not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk \\'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . \\nthis is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . \\ni got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . \\nand that is exactly what this film is ; art . \\ni\\'ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . \\nlet me backtrack a minute . \\nwhen i say \" intellectual ground \" , i don\\'t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . \\nwith most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . \\nthose movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . \\nyou see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . \\nthis is a thinking man\\'s slasher flick . \\nthe \" nosferatu \" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . \\nhe employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . \\nupon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock\\'s castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter\\'s ) . \\nthe next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not \\nreally a good sign . \\nhe then discovers through some reading that the count is a \" nosferatu \" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . \\nbut by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter\\'s hometown via boat . \\nwill hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? \\nthe character of orlock is , of course , dracula . \\nthe only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker\\'s novel . \\njust thought that was an interesting little side note . . . \\nprobably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment\\'s digitally restored cut , now available in stores . \\nhowever , this version is quite different than maunau\\'s original masterpiece . \\nthe movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang\\'s metropolis . \\nnow , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . \\nbut alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . \\nbut that\\'s just my bag ; you may like the newer , more \" modern \" version better . \\neither way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . \\nif you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . \\nif you\\'re like me , just do what i\\'ll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made . \\n'\n",

atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara\\'s entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout . \\nno kidding . \\nrequiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara\\'s movies and his controversial urban lifestyle . \\nmatty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him . \\nno doubt , he was off chasing the dragon . \\nin his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full \" dirty ol\\' man \" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs . \\nwider ! ) \\ntoward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out . \\nsomething happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it\\'s exactly what you think it was . \\nsuffice to say , there\\'s some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all . \\nthe blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . \\ncinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we\\'re back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits . \\n \" yeah ! ! ! \\nyeah ! ! ! \\narrrghhh ! \" \\nsays mr . hopper . \\ndirty old sod . ) \\nit\\'s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny . \\nhow\\'s that for cryptic ? \\nnever fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he\\'s all about . \\ni can picture it now . \\n \" take off yer clothes , kid -- it\\'s essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you\\'re his visual id . \\nyou\\'re the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture . \\ntake it off ! \\ntake it all off ! ! ! \\nha ha ha ! \" \\nfriggin\\' vampire . \\nyeah , you , ferrara . \\na final word about matthew modine : he\\'s actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there\\'s something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor . \\nhe\\'s ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) . \\n[he was in that scene ? \\n-ed . ] \\nhere , he\\'s asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs . \\nhe throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it\\'s somehow lacking . \\nmodine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara\\'s flesh fair . \\nbetter luck next time , matt . \\nsomeday , you\\'ll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn\\'t really your fault in the first place . \\nmaybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world . \\n'\n",

      "b' * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * * \\nthe previous two \" alien \" films have each had their own unique styles to them . \\nthe ridley scott\\'s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film . \\njames cameron\\'s aliens was much more of an action film . \\nand i liked each film separately for which it was . \\nnow alien 3 is out . \\nand it is it\\'s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were . \\nunlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens . \\nthis is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off . \\nthe survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . \\nthe climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . \\nin the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel . \\nthis vessel crash lands on fury 109 . \\neveryone in the vessel is killed , except ripley . \\nthe facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash . \\nfury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison . \\nwhen closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet . \\nall the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years . \\nripley\\'s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates . \\nas for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner\\'s sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet . \\nbeing an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons . \\nso the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own . \\ni will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here . \\nthe alien is loose and no one believes ripley\\'s outstanding story . \\nshe finds comfort in the arms of the colony\\'s doctor . \\nyes , after 57 years ripley has sex . \\nit is not gratuitous , in fact , we don\\'t even see them kiss , but it is just as well . \\na sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film . \\nthere is a lot more gore in alien 3 . \\nin fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . \\nit also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! \\ni won\\'t say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . \\nsigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character . \\nher scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination . \\nthe rest of the cast is also quite good . \\nnotably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 . \\nalien 3 has a very distinct look . \\nthis is due largely to its director , david fincher . \\nmr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here . \\nhis direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no \" alien \" film has before . \\nfor mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . \\nthe music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry . \\nelliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the \" alien \" series been set in . \\nthis time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner\\'s aliens ) . \\nthis score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring . \\nthis is a great score . \\nthe ending to alien 3 is quite good . \\nthere were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely . \\ni will not ruin the ending for you . \\ngo see the film . \\ni consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season . \\nalien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien . \\nand when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in . \\n'\n",
      "b'what is a scary movie anyhow ? \\nis it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? \\nis it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? \\npossibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . \\nwhat ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters . \\nmovies like \" halloween \" and \" psycho \" which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled \" the exorcist \" , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 \" the exorcist \" comes back to the big screen in a version you\\'ve never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending . \\nchris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan . \\nwhile working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden . \\nwhen chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter . \\nfather karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl . \\nchrist , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl . \\nexcrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death . \\nnow we get to the experience \" the exorcist \" the way it was meant to be seen in a director\\'s cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more . \\nthe movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing . \\nthe voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness . \\nas a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is \" the exorcist \" nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on . \\nellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in \" requiem for a dream \" to which she is getting rave reviews for . \\njason miller ( jason patrik\\'s dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along . \\ni was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff ! \\nanyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going . \\nhopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy . \\n'\n",

      "b\"`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . \\nto pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . \\nsomething like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . \\nwith the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror . \\njudging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . \\nthe movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably . \\ndone right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . \\nunfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . \\nthe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . \\ni will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward . \\nthose guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . \\nthese bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . \\nboy , are these bats ugly . \\nthey are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart . \\nthey've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . \\na whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . \\nthey have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do . \\nthe bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . \\nbut no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers . \\nthe film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . \\non the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . \\nbut sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . \\neven the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . \\nthe sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . \\nthe scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field' . \\nmeyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . \\nher memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' . \\neverything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . \\nthe supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . \\nin fact , that may have worked out better in the end . \\ntake one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . \\nunfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . \\nin the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . \\nmccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . \\nthe entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . \\nsomething like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? \\ni just want my money .

      "b'what hath kevin williamson wrought ? \\nwhile the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films . \\nthose williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_ . \\nadd to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy . \\nthe influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas . \\nfirst , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling . \\nthis sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer\\'s look . \\ndressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman , \\nsans the hook . \\none thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise . \\nstudents at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of \" mythology \" passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness . \\nit hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn\\'t ) . \\nmichelle , slain by the \" killer lurking in the backseat \" of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well . \\nthe setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares . \\ntoo many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film\\'s chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door . \\nbut that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there\\'s also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre . \\nbanks and horta\\'s ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor . \\nsome laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i\\'m not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so . \\nthe filmmakers don\\'t get much help from their onscreen talent . \\ni was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _ \\nstarlet jennifer love hewitt , but i\\'d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man , jared leto . \\n_dawson\\'s_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor . \\ngranted , the cast is hampered by their material . \\nloretta devine , who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard . \\nthe recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely , kevin williamson--to stay alive . \\nif other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers\\' many victims . \\n'\n",

? \\'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing . \\nsometimes both . \\nclever , indeed . \\nbut , who goes next ? \\nno one knows . \\nthree different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the \" scream \" 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read . \\nstill , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? \\'or , at least , what her mother was secretly . \\nwhen sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through \" woodsboro , \" written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of \" scream 3 \" ? ? ? s finest moments . \\nokay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the \" scream \" fan . \\nno , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said \" dramatic element \" ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with \" scream \" . \\nthroughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films . \\ngranted that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore . \\nhonestly , i like this approach . \\nit ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven . \\nhe knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience . \\nsome critics have noted that \" scream 3 \" seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? \\'maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? \\'if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s . \\nwhat puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer . \\nit does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying . \\nall in all , \" scream 3 \" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films . \\nas a trilogy , \" scream \" was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat . \\nalmost sad to see it go . \\nbut then , it does seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and \" scream 3 \" does a fine job of providing closure to its characters . \\nfor now , \" scream \" holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid . \\nnot too shabby . \\n'\n",
      "b\"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \\nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . \\nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . \\neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \\nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \\nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \\nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \\nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \\nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \\nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' \\nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' \\na troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \\nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \\njoe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \\nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \\nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \\njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \\nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \\njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \\nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \\nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \\nthe ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \\nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \\nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \\nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \\nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \\nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \\nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \\nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . \\nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . \\nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \\njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . ' \\nthere are two predominant images of new york . \\nthe first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty . \\nthe other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth . \\njoe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter . \\nmirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men . \\njoe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions . \\nthe people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity . \\nwhat has become of joe's american dream ? \\nschlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party . \\njoe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex . \\nat the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami . \\ncontrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence . \\nthere is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors . \\nthe party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals . \\njoe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils . \\nthe american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent . \\nas joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him . \\nhis masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished . \\nfor joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity . \\ntossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami . \\nthe final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window . \\ninstead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe . \\nreflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice . \\nthe scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before . \\nthe world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream . \\nno longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means . \\nmidnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream . \\nthere is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family . \\nthen there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city . \\njoe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york . \\nduring his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man . \\nan allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons . \\n\"\n",
      "b'you\\'d think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it . \\nthat\\'s a bit more difficult . \\nthe farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies . \\nif you\\'re not nice to it , you lose . \\ngalaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks\\'s spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned . \\n \" the show\\'s been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . \" \\nthat is the current tagline of \" galaxy quest , \" a star trek - type show that\\'s no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns . \\nit also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show\\'s obsessive fans who never fail to dress in \" galaxy quest \" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble . \\njason nesmith ( tim allen ) played \" commander peter quincy taggart \" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do . \\nthe attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt . \\ndane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character\\'s cheesy trademark line \" by grabthar\\'s hammer , you shall be avenged \" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans . \\none day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of \" galaxy quest \" followers . \\nthey are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia . \\nthey have mistaken the \" galaxy quest \" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel . \\nthe next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film\\'s only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) . \\nnesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes . \\nnext thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship . \\nof course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them . \\nbut after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians . \\ni was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked . \\ntaking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody . \\nnothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration . \\nthe highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub\\'s fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek . \\nwhile scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell \" i need more power down here captain ! \" , \\nchen\\'s cry for help is more to the tune of \" the core , like , won\\'t take it or something . \" \\nit\\'s a hoot , but it doesn\\'t stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren\\'t far behind . \\ngalaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it\\'s not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season . \\nby grabthar\\'s hammer , this is a hell of a movie . \\n'\n",
      "b'there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . \\none of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . \\nits popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . \\ncasablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . \\none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . \\nit was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn\\'t been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers\\' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . \\nhowever , the movie was commercially successful and earned three \" oscars \" , including the one for the best film . \\nuntil this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . \\nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . \\nin december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . \\nthousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . \\nmany shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . \\nhis best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of \" sticking his neck for nobody \" . \\nhowever , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . \\nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . \\none of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . \\nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . \\nthe couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . \\nrick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . \\nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . \\nbogart\\'s portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . \\nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . \\nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn\\'t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . \\nfor many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . \\nbut the reason for that isn\\'t the romance itself - it\\'s the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . \\nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . \\nthe supporting actors also did a marvellous job . \\nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston\\'s maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . \\nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . \\nunfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . \\nhowever , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . \\ncaptain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . \\ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . \\nrains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault\\'s relationship towards rick , and rick\\'s final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . \\ntogether with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . \\nprofessional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . \\nany way , even if we don\\'t see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration . \\n'\n",

\\nit is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . \\n \" se7en \" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . \\nby those jabs , i\\'m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the \" batman \" franchise , but \" a time to kill \" was an immensely overrated disappointment . \\nfor a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled . \\na good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter . \\nwriter andrew kevin walker didn\\'t recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for \\'95s twisted thriller , \" se7en \" . \\ndirector schumacher doesn\\'t have that innate ability to make you watch things you don\\'t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing . \\nhe must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don\\'t see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it\\'s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) . \\nhowever , gratuitous is joel\\'s middle name . \\nhe must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint . \\nno , he doesn\\'t go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness . \\nhe doesn\\'t leave much to the imagination . \\nit\\'s manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . \\nthe script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! ) \\ncraft . \\ncase in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ?

around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . \\nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world\\'s architectural landmarks . \\ndesigning a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . \\nadded to that , many of this city\\'s streets are the twin

\\nthe story of \" babe : pig in the city \" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn\\'t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . \\nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual\\'s worth , challenging conformity , and one\\'s purpose in life . \\n \" babe \" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . \\nthis film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . \\nbut this film\\'s goals aren\\'t as lofty as the first\\'s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . \\nhoggett\\'s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is

      "b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax\\'s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \\nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \\nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \\nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \\nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line\\'s a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \\nand scream\\'s rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \\nit\\'s hard to understate this last point . \\nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \\nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion\\'s share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2\\'s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film\\'s title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter\\'s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \\n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \\nand , much like mr . tarantino\\'s screenwriting , mr . williamson\\'s work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \\nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \\nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson\\'s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \\nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it\\'s only at about the film\\'s midway point when it becomes engaging . \\nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film\\'s principal narrative ; this time around , we\\'re following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \\nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i\\'ve ever seen ) . \\nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn\\'t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream\\'s ; while the first film\\'s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \\nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \\nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \\nthey\\'re joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \\nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn\\'t necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \\nthere\\'s a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney\\'s new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\\'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy\\'s fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale\\'s newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens\\' portia di rossi ) . \\nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \\nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \\none problem that scream didn\\'t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \\nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson\\'s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \\nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \\n ( it doesn\\'t help matters any that the killer\\'s alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \\nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \\nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \\nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it\\'s head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \\nthey\\'re staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \\nit\\'s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \\nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \\ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there\\'s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \\non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \\nshe doesn\\'t have any compelling presence , and there\\'s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she\\'s the returning heroine . \\ngiven this , and the fact that there\\'s no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal\\'s role isn\\'t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan\\'s shoes ) , it\\'s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \\nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \\nthe film\\'s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you\\'ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \\n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would\\'ve seemed obvious . ) \\nbut hey , as rose mcgowan\\'s character said in the first film : \" no , please don\\'t kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \\nlook what that got her . \\n'\n",

      "b'for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america\\'s finest actresses . \\nin her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison\\'s largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well . \\nthe film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina . \\nthrough voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn\\'t survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident . \\nthat\\'s just the beginning of her troubles . \\nbone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come . \\nanney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident . \\nanney\\'s brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill . \\nglen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( \" when are you gonna make your daddy proud ? \\ni\\'ll tell you when - never ! \" \\nhe\\'s told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper . \\nwhen anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour . \\nthings turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment . \\nwhile set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today\\'s society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other . \\nthe real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance . \\nher work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone\\'s performance stands up well . \\nleigh\\'s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she\\'s not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character\\'s moods in and out of explosive rage . \\none can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away . \\nof the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker\\'s performance . \\nthere\\'s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance . \\nstill , it cannot be denied that anne meredith\\'s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power . \\nhuston\\'s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone . \\nher sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective . \\nhuston\\'s talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile . \\nthe film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience . \\nperhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing . \\n'\n",

      "b\"girl 6 is , in a word , a mess . \\ni was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film . \\nthere was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative . \\nif there was a point to the film , i missed it . \\ngirl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers . \\nthe plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator . \\nshe begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her . \\nalso , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) . \\nhe is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him . \\nher neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 . \\nhe also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex . \\nthe soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring . \\nit kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting . \\nfor parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background . \\nin the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting . \\nof course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music . \\nprince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans . \\nof the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy . \\nhe was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 . \\nhe should have stuck to acting in this film . \\nthere are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up . \\nthere are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers . \\nin that film , they worked to propel the narrative . \\nin this film , they just made me more confused . \\nthere are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become . \\nother than that , though , nothing much happens . \\nthere are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster . \\ni'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past . \\nin girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering . \\nhe had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there . \\ngirl 6 earns a grade of d . \\n\"\n",
      "b'you\\'ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . \\nthe title is generic . \\nit\\'s meaningless . \\nand i can\\'t believe it\\'s good business . \\nwhen you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? \\nyuck . \\nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \\nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \\nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i\\'ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it\\'s not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \\nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \\nhis track record isn\\'t as solid as schwarzenegger\\'s , but he\\'s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \\nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong\\'s premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \\n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo\\'s radically different director\\'s cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \\nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo\\'s more operatic offerings . \\nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo\\'s subsequent broken arrow . \\nhere\\'s the rundown . \\nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that\\'s alain\\'s exact double . \\nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \\nalain does some investigating . \\nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \\nassuming michael\\'s identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael\\'s girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \\nthat\\'s as much as you need to know . \\nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \\nthere\\'s a love story , too , but i didn\\'t find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \\nshe\\'s great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can\\'t really be described as \" acting . \" \\nof course , \" acting \" isn\\'t really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme\\'s ) . \\nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \\n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \\nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme\\'s stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \\nthere\\'s only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \\nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \\nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo\\'s hard-boiled , it\\'s an amazing moment . \\nbut it\\'s a moment that\\'s hard to reproduce in hollywood . \\n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn\\'t yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \\nwhile woo\\'s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \\nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam\\'s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \\nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam\\'s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \\nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there\\'s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn\\'t always overcome the limitations of its genre . \\nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme\\'s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \\nbut it\\'s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it\\'s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \\nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man\\'s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \\n'\n",

      "b'five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king\\'s writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king . \\nunlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore . \\nplot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers . \\ncritique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional \" evil \" characters . \\nits only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles . \\nthe real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about . \\nof course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be \" misunderstood \" , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified . \\nand let\\'s not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) . \\nam i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ? \\nor even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat\\'s ass about anyone in this film ? \\nwell , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin . \\nfurthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone\\'s life to present this story . \\nin fact , the story is empty within itself . \\ni truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not . \\nwow . \\nhow interesting . \\nthe plot\\'s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) . \\nwhip out those thinking caps , kids ! \\nhmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter \" evil \" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity . \\nhmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls . \\nwhat a crock ! \\ni am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging . \\nin fact , it was one big bore . \\ni didn\\'t see the point of the movie , i didn\\'t see the point of the story and i certainly didn\\'t see the point in tom hanks\\' big double-chin . \\nall in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey . \\ngive that man an award or something ! \\n'\n",
      "b'one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy\\'s wedding . \\nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \\nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn\\'t made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \\nbut the fact is , betsy\\'s wedding is also an alan alda film . \\nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \\nwritten and directed by alda , betsy\\'s wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \\nalda\\'s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \\nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \\nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \\nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \\nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \\nshe\\'s supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \\nand to make matters worse , ringwald\\'s performance matches her appearance . \\nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald\\'s screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \\nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride\\'s working-class , italian family and the groom\\'s rich , gentile family . \\nringwald\\'s folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \\nwalsh\\'s clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \\nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" \\nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film\\'s most pleasant surprises . \\nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \\nit\\'s anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \\nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \\nlapaglia\\'s sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \\nand what\\'s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \\nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \\ni don\\'t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia\\'s over-the-top performance should not be missed . \\nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \\njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda\\'s unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o\\'hara ) . \\nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride\\'s financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \\nthe film adopts alda\\'s psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \\nas a filmmaker , alda\\'s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \\nand while he doesn\\'t have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \\n'\n",
      "b'anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon\\'s fact based novel the king and i , and it\\'s big , expensive and soulless . \\nthough good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson\\'s script . \\nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . \\nthis is jodie foster\\'s first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn\\'t the best choice to show off her acting chops . \\nshe\\'s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king\\'s ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because \" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . \\nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . \\nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this ( \" father , have i offended you in some way ? \\nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . \\nmeanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . \\nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain\\'s doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . \\nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king\\'s prejudices . \\nhe , though self-righteous as ever , can\\'t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . \\nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king\\'s younger daughters dies . \\nit\\'s your classic deathbed scene , with the girl\\'s mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . \\nanna then comes in and cries a bit . \\nthe sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . \\ni\\'m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . \\nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . \\nwe never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . \\nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . \\ni do not doubt tennant\\'s ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . \\nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . \\neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . \\nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . \\ni liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . \\nfoster\\'s generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . \\nyun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam\\'s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . \\nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . \\nthe cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . \\nthis is an emotionless costume epic . \\n'\n",
      "b' \" first rule of fight club is , don\\'t talk about fight club . \" \\nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it\\'s not even worth mentioning . \\ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \\nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i\\'m surprised i didn\\'t walk out . \\nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \\nit\\'s very rare that a film so hyped up as \" fight club \" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \\nthe story goes like this . \\nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \\nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \\napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \\nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \\nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it\\'s on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \\nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \\nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \\nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser\\'s attention , and a club is formed . \\nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \\nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \\nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \\nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \\ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \\ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \\neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \\ni couldn\\'t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \\nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \\ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \\nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \\nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \\nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \\nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \\nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \\nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while \" fight club \" nears what i think might be the end . \\nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \\nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \\non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \\nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \\nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won\\'t do any good if everything else is in need of support . \\nalso , i\\'m afraid that immature men might respond to the film\\'s violence . \\nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \\nwhen the film ends , i\\'m just glad to get home and take some advil . \\nyou\\'ll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says \" this is so f * * * ing stupid . \" \\n'\n",
      "b\"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \\nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \\nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \\nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \\nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \\ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \\nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \\nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \\nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \\nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \\nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \\nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \\nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \\nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \\nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \\nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \\nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \\nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \\ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \\notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \\nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \\nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \\nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \\npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \\nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \\na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \\nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \\nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \\nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \\nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \\nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \\nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \\n\"\n",

      "b\"this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . \\njoseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . \\nloggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . \\nthe beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . \\nthe beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . \\nthis is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school . \\njoshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents . \\nall this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . \\nthe plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . \\nhis answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes . \\nthis search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist . \\nnow , that's a smart kid . \\nbut joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . \\none of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . \\nthroughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) \\nquestion about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . \\nnothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted . \\nwhat comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody . \\nthe film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) \\ntells him his grandfather is all right . \\nhis quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . . \\nmaybe that's for another film down the road . \\nthis part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo . \\nas this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . \\nthough if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . \\nwell , god bless him , if he can do that . \\nthis is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . \\nit's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . \\nand that family of his , they're too good for words . \\nyet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . \\nfor those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one . \\n\"\n",
      "b\"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . \\nin as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . \\nhe's mean . \\ni mean really mean . \\nthe opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . \\nevery day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . \\nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . \\none day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . \\nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . \\nanother person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . \\naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . \\nsimon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . \\nwhen simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . \\nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . \\nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . \\nit doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . \\none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . \\nhe's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . \\ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . \\nthey play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . \\ngreg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . \\nhe gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . \\ncuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . \\nthe screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . \\nthe best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . \\nmelvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . \\ncarol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . \\nsimon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . \\ncombined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . \\nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . \\nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . \\ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . \\nthere's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . \\nthis is that little dog . \\nhe plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . \\naward or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie . \\n\"\n",

      "b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \\nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\\'t ) . \\nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \\nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \\nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \\nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\\'s a catch -- he\\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\\'s now infected with alien dna . \\npatrick\\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \\nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\\'s primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \\nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \\nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \\nmr . brancato\\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \\nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \\nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \\nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \\nand she\\'s not even empathic ! \\nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he\\'s going to rape her . \" \\nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \\nthere\\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he\\'s in aisle 1 ! \" \\ninforms eve ) . \\nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \\nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \\nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\\'s brain ? \\nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \\nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \\nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\\'s being foisted upon the public . \\nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \\nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \\nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \\nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she\\'s so empowered . \" \\na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\\'s * what i call empowerment . \\n'\n",

\\nyes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . \\nthe location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the \" t \" and antonio banderas the \" a \" ) . \\nmore importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . \\nveteran readers know that , as a rule , i don\\'t encourage people to patronize lousy films . \\nmost of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the \" let\\'s go laugh at the failings of others \" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . \\nbut things are different this summer . \\nquality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i\\'m concerned , it\\'s fair to find our kicks where we may . \\n \" original sin \" will never join such treasures as \" valley of the dolls , \" \" road house \" and \" showgirls \" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it\\'ll do until something worse comes along . \\nthe film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , \" waltz into darkness \" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , \" mississippi mermaid \" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie\\'s character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . \\nthe freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , \" this is not a love story , it is a story about love . \" \\nwary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . \\na practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . \\nimagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . \\njulia explains that she sent a different woman\\'s image because she didn\\'t want to be selected solely for her pretty face . \\nluis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , \" we have something in common , we are both not to trusted . \" \\nafter their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . \\njolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers\\' insistence on using one of banderas\\' legs to cover jolie\\'s crotch makes it look like he\\'s trying to climb her . \\nluis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . \\nhis blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . \\nluis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication . \\nshortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . \\nfinally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . \\nincidentally , if you\\'re afraid i\\'m giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . \\nalong the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie \" 61 * \" ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman\\'s sister to find out what happened to the real julia . \\nluis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can\\'t have her , he will kill her . \\noh , the pathos of it all . \\nthe cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . \\nbanderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . \\nas for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . \\nhis most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . \\nif anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene . \\nand if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them \" original sin . \" \\n'\n",
      "b'this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned . \\nthe won\\'t appear till later in the article , so you\\'re safe for now . \\neyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect \\nstarring : tom cruise ( dr . \\nbill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : \" traumnovelle \" by : arthur schnitzer \\nthis is an interesting film . \\ni must first off state , that you musn\\'t believe any of the rumors of the film . \\ncruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn\\'t shoot heroin , and there\\'s not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist . \\nthe look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written . \\nthe translation , \" dream novel , \" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film . \\nthere is a noticable amount of graininess to the film . \\nrather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting . \\ni would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could . \\nthis and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly . \\nas an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one . \\nthe film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur . \\nyou see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice . \\n16 months for this ? \\nwow . \\nreflection is the biggest killer for this film . \\ntheir apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly . \\none more topic of heated discussion : i saw the \" austin powers \" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you\\'ll probably not see them . \\ntwo girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it\\'s supposed to be . \\nspoilers below : \\nthe film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree . \\nthey go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack . \\nbill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party\\'s entertainment . \\nsoon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed . \\nbill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time . \\nthe next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations . \\nthey both discover that they both knew about the flirting . \\nbill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry . \\nin her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects . \\nbill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter . \\nwhen his patient\\'s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer . \\nhe sees \" opportunity \" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted . \\nas he strolls home , he encounters a hooker . \\nseeing another \" opportunity \" arise , he follows the hooker home . \\nthey toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone . \\nhe breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night . \\nhe passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in . \\nwhen he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded . \\nbill is intrigued and wants to go to one . \\nnick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password . \\nwhat follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father . \\nthe young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening . \\nhe gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair . \\nafter partaking in some strange \" religious \" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies . \\na woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party . \\nhe is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group . \\nafter getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events . \\nunable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together . \\nin the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died . \\ni\\'m trying to save a bit of the film here , it\\'s worth sitting through to get to this point . \\nthis is only about 100 minutes at this point . \\nthis is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it . \\nit will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film . \\nit\\'s got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values . \\nbut they all serve to show why they are bad in one\\'s life . \\ni recommend this film highly on many merits . \\ncruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself . \\n'\n",
      "b\"as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous . \\nalmost everyone knows it , well at least in north america . \\nso it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it . \\nit has been done before with varying results . \\nthis version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time . \\nthe basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . \\nthere is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . \\nafter the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . \\n . \\nunlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end . \\nthe ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her . \\nalthough this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . . \\nthe story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion . \\nthis addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical . \\nfor example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired . \\nfor instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that . \\nespecially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne . \\nthe characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women . \\nalthough the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable . \\nthe nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie . \\nas a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique . \\nbut , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly . \\nthe actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . \\nthe acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . \\nall in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land . \\nbut , don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening . \\nso although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing \\n\"\n",
      "b'the tagline for this film is : \" some houses are just born bad \" . \\nso i didn\\'t expect too much from this . \\nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . \\ni thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . \\ni thought , mabe it will be fun ? \\nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . \\nbut by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . \\nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . \\nhere is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . \\namong them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . \\nactually , the doctor is researching the \" primordial fear reaction \" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . \\nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself . \\nit rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . \\nportals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . \\na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . \\nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . \\nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . \\nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . \\nis that exciting or what ? \\nthe worst thing about it is that it didn\\'t have to be bad . \\nit\\'s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , \\'\\' by shirley jackson . \\na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . \\nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \\n \" the blair witch project \" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . \\nand with a $70 mill . \\nbudget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . \\nde bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . \\nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . \\nbut why give him a more serious material ? \\nin the end \" haunting \" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont\\'s career as a director . \\nyet it wouldn\\'t be fair to say that everything is bad . \\nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . \\nbut this is where the good things end . \\nthe music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . \\nit\\'s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn\\'t engage . \\nat first you do not know what\\'s going on . \\nis this part of the experiment ? \\nare these hallucinations ? \\nprojections of the subconscience ? \\nparanoia ? \\nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . \\nthe house is actually possessed . \\nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . \\nfor ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that\\'s what i got ? \\ni believe hichock once said that \" it\\'s better to wait for a climax , than to see one \" . \\nthis may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . \\nthey are impossible to take seriously . \\nany paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick\\'s \" the shining \" , are absolutely baseless . \\n \" shining \" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \\n \" haunting \" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . \\nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . \\ncasting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . \\nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : \" some films are just born stupid \" . \\n'\n",
      "b\"out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \\nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . \\nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \\nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \\nhe doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \\nvalentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \\nhe's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . \\nseeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \\nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \\nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \\nwhat a mess . \\ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \\nthe limey does exactly that . \\nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \\nthere is no method to this movie's madness . \\nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \\nthe plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \\nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \\ni felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \\nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \\nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \\nhe's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \\npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . \\nhe's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \\nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \\nwhy soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . \\nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . \\n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \\nshall we go back to basics ? \\n\"\n",

      "b'one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . \\nsuch was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . \\nmade in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , \" warped , twisted masterpiece \" of lynch clan . \\nkim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . \\nbut , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . \\nthe movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . \\ncavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . \\nduring one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . \\nafter she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh\\'s stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . \\nshe is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . \\napart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn\\'t got anything in common with the works of director\\'s more talented father . \\ndespite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . \\njennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . \\nthe actors aren\\'t good either . \\njulian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn\\'t suit him . \\nbill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena\\'s boyfriend . \\nsherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn\\'t help this film . \\nthe screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer\\'s diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . \\none of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh\\'s \" regular \" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . \\nthe twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . \\nall in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger\\'s career . \\n'\n",

\\nseagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . \\none of caine\\'s cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , \\nof course . \\nat one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn\\'t have any options but blow stuff up . \\nhe even goes as far as to say , \" i don\\'t want to kill someone , \" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . \\ni have no problem with violence . \\ni\\'m a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . \\nin the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . \\nat some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . \\nthis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn\\'t take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer\\'s \" con air . \" \\nbut seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . \\ni wouldn\\'t mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . \\nbut seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer\\'s mind . \\nthe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can\\'t take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . \\nthen at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn\\'t get the message from the trailers . \\nwhat seagal doesn\\'t realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn\\'t comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . \\nas far as seagal and his acting , he\\'s rather boring . \\nhe squints , he kills . \\nperiod . \\nnothing else . \\noh , yeah , there\\'s corny one-liners ( \" i\\'m gonna reach out and touch someone ! \" ) . \\nof course , he\\'s the star , and we\\'re supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . \\nmichael caine , who\\'s a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold . \\nhe does it well , i guess , but this is no \" alfie . \" \\nof coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him . \\nhis big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible . \\nand we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from \" full metal jacket \" ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal\\'s ego . \\nand also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey\\'s assasins . \\nanyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal\\'s movies is to judge all of them ( except for \" under siege \" and \" executive decision , \" though the latter is not really a \" seagal movie \" ) . \\nthey all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch . \\ni mean , if you do rent it , and i don\\'t reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . \\nbut i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one . \\nmy ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) \\n'\n",

) with the power of an electrical storm . \\nalmost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . \\nhere , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . \\nbranagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . \\non the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . \\nhelen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein\\'s surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . \\nthe rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . \\nvisually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . \\nthe spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley\\'s frankenstein is a wonder to behold . \\nkenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all \\ni once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by \\nmy hand . . \" . \\nand the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator\\'s body on fire . \\nthe film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . \\nand a terrifying last close-up on the creature\\'s smiling face . \\ncan a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? \\nto whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? \\nshelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . \\nfollowing her example , branagh does the same . \\nhis film is a tragic saga about playing god . \\nvictor frankenstein is not an evil man . \\nhe wanted to change the world to the better . \\nin this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . \\nproduced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . \\nin comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . \\nbut when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . \\nbut stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan\\'s \" interview with the vampire \" . \\nalthough the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . \\nbranagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly\\'s classic novel . \\n'\n",
      "b' \" very bad things , \" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn\\'t help but be won over by the material . \\nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . \\nthe groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . \\nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . \\nafter a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone\\'s terror , she is killed . \\nas robert puts it : \" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . \" \\nafter a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . \\n \" okay , there is only one option now . \\nyou can forget about calling the police , \" he says . \\nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . \\n \" very bad things , \" which is actor peter berg\\'s feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , \" there\\'s something about mary , \" wanted to be . \\nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . \\nthe screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . \\nduring the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . \\nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn\\'t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . \\nthere\\'s more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . \\ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . \\ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . \\nby the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , \" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , \" i couldn\\'t help but crack up at how \" balls-to-the-wall \" this film had become . \\njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern\\'s wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . \\nit is at this level that , \" very bad things , \" was so entertaining and surprising . \\njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . \\nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . \\nalthough i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : \" very bad things , \" is not a movie for everyone . \\nit is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . \\nluckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . \\nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and \" safe \" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . \\n'\n",
      "b'i am continually amazed at movies like this . \\nthat some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays . \\n \" wild wild west \" is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault . \\nin short , this movie is a comedy without laughs . \\nso many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal . \\nthe high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it\\'s still pretty boring . \\nwill smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character . \\nwest is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they\\'re pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach . \\ntalk about deeply developed characters . \\nat any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny . \\nthe year is 1869 . \\nseveral top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) . \\npresident grant sends west and gordon to investigate . \\nthere\\'s evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana . \\nwest and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate . \\nas it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states . \\ni\\'d go further with the plot , but there isn\\'t any point . \\nthis film\\'s narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess . \\ni only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly . \\nthere isn\\'t one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that\\'s pretty disasterous when you consider that it\\'s primarily a comedy . \\nas i said , the fault is totally that of the script . \\nwhen you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done . \\nthe leads could\\'ve been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would\\'ve been awful . \\nno one , and i mean no one , can make a line like \" bye bye , mr . knife guy ! \" \\nsound good . \\nstill , this film has a lot going for it visually . \\nthe set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy . \\nthe cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese\\'s brilliant \" goodfellas \" ) , is absolutely stunning . \\nhe lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look . \\ni won\\'t fault barry sonnenfeld either . \\nhe does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really isn\\'t anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw . \\ndespite being beautifully made , \" wild wild west \" becomes quite boring after the half-way point . \\nthe appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does . \\nif \" wild wild west \" didn\\'t look so good , it would be almost insufferable . \\nas it is , it\\'s somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining . \\nit hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there isn\\'t anything much worse than an unfunny comedy . \\n'\n",
      "b'godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the \" who cares about plot \" summer movie . \\na loose remake of the 1954 \" classic \" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin\\'s big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . \\nthe script isn\\'t just \" dumbed down , \" it\\'s lobotomized . \\ngodzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . \\npresumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . \\nthat\\'s not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they\\'re just not as readily susceptible . \\nthis is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . \\nstargate was a financial success . \\nindependence day was a runaway hit . \\nand , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it\\'s virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . \\nnice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . \\ngodzilla isn\\'t completely without merit , although it is close . \\nthere\\'s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . \\nfrankly , while the special effects are competent , they\\'re not all that stunning . \\nthere\\'s nothing new here ; it\\'s jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . \\nmaybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . \\ngodzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . \\nthe imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . \\n ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) \\nworst of all , godzilla isn\\'t even exciting . \\nwith the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn\\'t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . \\neven the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . \\nindependence day may have been dumb , but it was full of \" adrenaline moments \" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . \\nin this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . \\nactually , part of the problem is that we\\'re never sure who we\\'re supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . \\nthe plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . \\nafter sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . \\nhe does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . \\nin the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . \\non hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . \\nin his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . \\nin nick\\'s words , godzilla is \" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . \" \\nas luck would have it , nick\\'s old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . \\nalong with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . \\nthen , just when the military has rejected nick\\'s theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . \\ninstead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . \\nunfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it\\'s becoming boring . \\nthe whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . \\nhe could climb the empire state building . \\nat ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . \\ngodzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . \\nthere\\'s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick\\'s last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . \\nboth of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : \" ebert , \" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and \" gene \" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . \\nebert\\'s re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , \" thumbs up for new york . \" \\nthe siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it\\'s used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . \\nand , although the \" characters \" don\\'t serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . \\ngodzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . \\nthis is largely because emmerich doesn\\'t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . \\nthat\\'s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren\\'t capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren\\'t a-list names . \\nthen again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . \\nmaria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . \\nultimately , it doesn\\'t really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . \\ntristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . \\nit may also be word-of-mouth-proof . \\nthose who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . \\nso , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it\\'s like spitting into the wind . \\nemmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . \\nit\\'s probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they\\'ve been had . \\n'\n",

      "b'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \\ni didn\\'t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \\nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \\nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \\ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \\nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \\nfor those of you who don\\'t know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , \" a graduate of several 12-step programs . \" \\nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \\nstuart\\'s relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d\\'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \\nthen , disaster strikes . \\nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \\nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \\nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \\nalthough smalley\\'s dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \\nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \\nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \\nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called \" serious dramas \" of today . \\nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \\nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven\\'t seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \\nyou\\'ll laugh . . . you\\'ll \\ncry . . . . it\\'s \\nall there . \\n'\n",
      "b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nlike its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \\na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \\nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \\nas boogie nights opens , he\\'s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \\nrecruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \\nwholeheartedly embraced by jack\\'s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \\nhis lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \\nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \\nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson\\'s accomplished command of the camera is without question . \\nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco\\'s unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \\nit\\'s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker\\'s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it\\'s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he\\'s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he\\'s borrowing from some of the best , and it\\'s entirely effective within the context of this film . \\nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it\\'s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \\nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \\nwhile much of the film\\'s humour pertains to the characters\\' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope\\'s demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get \\'freaky deaky\\' with the music -- it\\'s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \\na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk\\'s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \\nably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson\\'s personal collection ) , there\\'s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \\nit\\'s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film\\'s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \\nafter the debacle with 1996\\'s milos forman film , the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \\nhowever , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it\\'s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there\\'s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \\nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horner\\'s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there\\'s a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it\\'s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \\nif anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \\njack horner\\'s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \\nin both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack\\'s retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer\\'s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood\\'s \" it\\'s not about the little details , it\\'s about the big picture ! \" \\nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \\nin boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers\\' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there\\'s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an \\'artistic\\' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \\nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i\\'ve ever done \" , it\\'s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \\nmr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \\nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn\\'t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film\\'s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film\\'s * protagonist * literally doesn\\'t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it\\'s no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \\nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film\\'s finest exchanges . \\nand while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it\\'s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film\\'s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore\\'s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character\\'s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \\nstill , even if he doesn\\'t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \\nin any case , it\\'s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it\\'s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger\\'s \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \\nif this scene already wasn\\'t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \\nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \\nmr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \\nsimilarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver\\'s seat , sobbing \" i\\'m so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver\\'s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \\nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \\nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \\nmr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard\\'s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \\ni\\'m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \\nmr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it\\'s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \\nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ;

since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant\\'s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \\ndraw your own conclusions . \\nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \\nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it\\'s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \\nwhile the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle\\'s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \\nluis guzman\\'s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma\\'s carlito\\'s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who\\'s a hanger-on to jack\\'s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \\njack\\'s eventual acquiescence to maurice\\'s request leads to one of boogie nights\\' biggest comic payoffs . \\nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \\nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there\\'s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year . \\n'\n",

      "b'some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . \\nthat is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don\\'t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . \\nsuch rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . \\nsomething like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . \\none day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . \\nvan dorn is worried because he doesn\\'t believe that his daughter would run from home . \\nhowever , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . \\ninfuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast\\'s investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . \\nunfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . \\nthings change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . \\nalmost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . \\nit is a real shame , because very few movies in today\\'s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . \\nin late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . \\nfor schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . \\non one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . \\nbut that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . \\nthe new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called \" sexual revolution \" , same as all other \" revolutions \" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . \\ninstead of being \" liberated \" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . \\nschrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren\\'t so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . \\nthe difference between the two is simply in the line of work . \\nmany contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . \\non the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . \\nin the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn\\'t deserve to experience parent\\'s worst nightmare . \\nthe scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen\\'s fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . \\nvan dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . \\non the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn\\'s ( his own parents wouldn\\'t allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . \\neven the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . \\nunfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . \\nthe script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn\\'t show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \\napart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \\nbut the content might be more than interesting for today\\'s viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \\nuntil boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \\nhardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \\nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn\\'t be too surprising . \\nanyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . \\n'\n",

\" \\nto which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) \\nonly after we\\'ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . \\nnot that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . \\nin one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . \\nshe sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . \\ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner\\'s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . \\nthis scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it\\'s gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film\\'s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . \\nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . \\ni realized that these constructs on screen aren\\'t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . \\nthis would have been bad enough without the west\\'s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . \\ncompelling films about sexual crimes don\\'t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don\\'t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . \\nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they\\'re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . \\nin addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it\\'s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . \\nthis standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . \\nas it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . \\nperhaps the only positive elements in the general\\'s daughter are a couple of the performances . \\njames woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . \\ni also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . \\nnonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . \\nthe general\\'s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . \\n'\n",
      "b' \" you\\'ll go ape over tarzan because it\\'s more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! \" \\nokay , there\\'s the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . \\ndisney\\'s latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . \\nfather , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . \\nit\\'s amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . \\nbefore you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . \\nagainst the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . \\ntarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . \\nmuch of tarzan\\'s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his \" father , \" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . \\nall he\\'s looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . \\nwhen you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . \\nlook back on past disney animated features and you\\'ll see the trend . \\ngrowing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . \\none is an ape named terk ( rosie o\\'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . \\nboth provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . \\ni\\'m beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . \\njust fill in the blanks ! \\ncan you see it ? \\n \" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \\nwe\\'ve already had a fish and a crab , and we\\'ve had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \\nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ? \\nwell , there we go ! \" \\nof course , there\\'s gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . \\ntogether with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . \\nshe discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory \" you tarzan , me jane \" scene . \\nthankfully , those aren\\'t the exact words . \\nhowever , i found it distracting that tarzan is going \" ohh ohh ee ee \" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . \\nhow does he tell his name to another ape ? \\n \" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" \\nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \\nbut hey , tarzan\\'s a young adult . \\ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \\nisn\\'t that illegal in most countries ? \\noh , well . \\ni don\\'t think disney will be using my quote anymore . \\ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \\nthere\\'s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \\nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \\nthis isn\\'t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it\\'s just different . \\ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \\nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \\nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \\nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \\nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn\\'t just tarzan , it\\'s \" extreme tarzan . \" \\nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \\nlasting but a few seconds at most , it\\'s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \\nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \\nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o\\'donnell . \\ngoing into the film , i didn\\'t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \\nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that\\'s no boy ape , that rosie o\\'donnell . \" \\ndistracting to say the least . \\ni\\'ll admit i\\'ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn\\'t tell you how true this film stays to the book . \\nbut unless you\\'re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \\nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \\nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \\nthis time , i\\'ll just say that i went to mcdonald\\'s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \\n\\'nuff said . \\n'\n",

      "b'kadosh means sacred in hebrew . \\namos gitai\\'s fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . \\nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli\\'s modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic\\'s intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \\ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \\nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god\\'s law from only the male\\'s view . \\nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \\nthe story takes place in jerusalem\\'s jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \\nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . \\nit is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . \\nthe force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \\nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can\\'t at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \\nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \\nhe even thanks god that he didn\\'t make him a woman . \\nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \\nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \\nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \\nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \\nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \\nsince the hasidim look upon a woman\\'s role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man\\'s role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \\nshe receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" \\nmeir\\'s response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \\nmeir\\'s father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" \\nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \\nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \\ntheir religion doesn\\'t permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \\nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \\nso when meir\\'s father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \\nrivka\\'s spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \\nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \\nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \\nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . \\nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub . \\nmalka\\'s mother is worried that her daughter won\\'t get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn\\'t love . \\nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \\nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \\nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka\\'s wedding night . \\nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \\nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \\nbut the choices are obliterated by one\\'s beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \\nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \\ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \\nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed . \\n'\n",

      "b'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \\nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \\ni\\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \\nit\\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \\nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \\nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \\nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \\nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \\nit\\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \\ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \\nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \\nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \\nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \\nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \\nthankfully the film doesn\\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \\nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \\npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \\nhe\\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \\nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\\'s easy to sympathize with him . \\nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \\nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \\nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \\nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \\nthe resonance to donnie\\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\\'t always seem to have much meaning . \\nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\\'s never a and the family is suffering . \\nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \\nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \\na climax of sorts does occur , but there\\'s little feeling of a payoff . \\nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \\naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \\nit may be routine , but it\\'s good , and that\\'s respectful . \\n'\n",

( i have no idea why i just typed that . \\ni\\'m not even really paying attention anymore . ) \\nthe special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black . \\ni found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the \" cool weapons \" they had . \\nthe noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said . \\nand the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln\\'t have . \\nit\\'s director , barry sonnenfield , is known for \" black humor \" , directing both addams family movies . \\nthis movie was basically a \" black comedy \" , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong on what i think of this movie . \\nit\\'s not bad , i gave it * * * . \\nit was mostly entertaining throughout it\\'s run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it . \\nmy diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket . \\nof course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that\\'s beside the point . \\ni think . \\n'\n",
      "b'jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance . \\nfor the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film . \\ndaryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes . \\nthe parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) . \\nhe even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes . \\nhowever zero\\'s observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society . \\nhe could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) . \\narlo is not happy with his job . \\nhe is thrilled to be around zero\\'s brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer . \\nand they\\'re even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend\\'s boss means more to arlo than her . \\nthis is the situation when a new case comes knocking . \\ngregory stark ( ryan o\\'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys . \\nit seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . \\nnow , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . \\nto solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell . \\nhowever , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and \\nthis time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme . \\nfor the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . \\nzero effect is weakest in its obviously \" wacky \" scenes depicting daryl zero\\'s odd behavior . \\nsuch scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character . \\nhowever , there\\'s a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . \\nthat\\'s not to say that there\\'s not a place for humor in this film . \\nin fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller\\'s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer . \\nhowever , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren\\'t funny enough to stand on their own . \\nonce the investigation is underway , however , zero\\'s brilliance really begins to shine . \\nhis lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock\\'s own . \\nas the mystery begins to unfold , zero\\'s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer . \\nzero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . \\nzero\\'s relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes . \\nhowever , we are always kept distant from gloria\\'s character . \\nshe\\'s given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking . \\nperhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero\\'s zone of detachment . \\nbut , on the whole , it is frustrating . \\nbill pullman , when he\\'s not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero . \\nthere\\'s one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well . \\nand , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called \" zero \" seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name . \\nalthough zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise . \\n'\n",
      "b'have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ? \\nor if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ? \\nthese thought-provoking questions are the subject of \" final destination , \" which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999\\'s \" the sixth sense . \" \\nstylishly filmed and tautly directed by \" x-files \" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written \" teen-speak , \" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn\\'t use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue . \\nat the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris . \\nprogressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious \" coincidences , \" including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song \" rocky mountain high \" over the sound system in the airport bathroom . \\n \" john denver died in a plane crash , \" alex grudgingly mutters to himself . \\nonce seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off . \\narguing in the airport lobby , alex\\'s suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates . \\nas two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners . \\ncarter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate . \\nalex\\'s best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can\\'t because of his fearful parents . \\nthe teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker . \\nonly outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex\\'s premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life . \\nthat is only the setup of \" final destination , \" and the less said about what follows , the better . \\nsuffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself . \\nthe setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and \" final destination \" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years . \\ngraphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don\\'t know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away . \\ndevon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999\\'s underseen slasher-comedy , \" idle hands , \" is even more of a charismatic presence here . \\nthe conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn\\'t meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part . \\none scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful . \\nali larter ( 1999\\'s \" varsity blues \" ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father . \\nthe other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional . \\nthe movie is mainly sawa\\'s , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles . \\ntony todd ( 1992\\'s \" candyman \" ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory . \\nand the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy . \\nultimately , what is so good about \" final destination \" is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today\\'s horror films . \\nif anything , it\\'s safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again . \\n'\n",

      "b'in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . \\nwas it \" deep \" ? \\nnope . \\nhowever it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . \\nit was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was \" without the comic book uplift \" of the indiana jones and superman pictures . \\nwhich was true . \\nif what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man\\'s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place . \\nif those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn . \\nsome critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that \" this is batman as batman should be . \" ; \\nmr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year . \\nthe praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect . \\nthere was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton . \\nthe result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes . \\nthe villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman\\'s nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman\\'s body she gets pushed off a building . \\ni admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . \\nnothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten . \\nhints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast . \\nalas , these are only hints . \\nthere are , don\\'t misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis . \\na weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing . \\n'\n",

      "b'you\\'ve got to love disney . \\nno matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it\\'s animated . \\nkids have to go see the movie . \\nthen they have to get the toys . \\noh , the video came out ? \\ngot to buy it , or risk little billy\\'s temper tantrums for the next month . \\nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . \\nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \\nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \\neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \\nit\\'s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \\ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \\nwhat\\'s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \\nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \\nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \\nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \\nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \\nluckily , disney\\'s latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \\nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \\nsoon , china\\'s emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china\\'s defense . \\nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \\nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \\nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \\nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman\\'s role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points . \\nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one\\'s family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \\nby leaving home to fight in her father\\'s place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \\nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \\ni\\'m not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \\nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan\\'s army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga\\'s voice translates much better to animation . \\nyou have to hear it to understand . \\ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \\nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \\nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney\\'s own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \\nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . \\nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu\\'s hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \\nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \\nwhen mulan resolves to take her father\\'s place , she dons her father\\'s old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \\nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \\nit just left me thinking , \" that was really cool . \" \\na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang\\'s conscripted army . \\neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \\nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \\ni found the choice of b . d . \\nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short\\'s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything\\'s possible . \\nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \\none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \\nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \\njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa\\'s speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . \\nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa\\'s singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . \\nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . \\nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . \\nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . \\nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . \\ni guess clyde kusatsu wasn\\'t available . \\nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . \\nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better . \\n'\n",

\\nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \\npretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \\nhe was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \\nin a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . \\nit\\'s not better or worse than verhoven\\'s average film . \\nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \\nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \\nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ?

\\nthe answer is simple . \\nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \\nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \\nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \\nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \\nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \\nit\\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \\na void where its imagination should be . \\n'\n",

      "b\"fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . \\ntragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity . \\nmost of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . \\nthose two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends . \\nunfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal . \\nsadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process . \\non the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself . \\none of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . \\nin the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence . \\nthat movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) . \\nunfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality . \\ndeath wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out . \\nbefore the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) . \\nkersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime . \\nbronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine . \\nalthough bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film . \\nthe movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade . \\non the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey . \\nunfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang . \\nthe big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . \\nin short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . \\n ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) . \\n\"\n",

      "b'after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \\nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \\n \" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , \" he says , \" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , \\'see you soon . \\' \" \\nof course , it\\'s meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . \\nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \\nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \\ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \\njuzo itami\\'s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \\na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \\ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \\ngoro finds that tampopo\\'s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \\nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \\nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \\nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \\ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \\nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \\ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \\nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \\njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \\nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \\nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \\nthere\\'s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \\nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \\nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \\nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people\\'s lives . \\na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \\nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \\nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \\nthe viewer knows the husband\\'s intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \\nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \\nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \\npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \\nthen she falls over , dead . \\nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! \\nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" \\ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \\nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \\nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \\ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo\\'s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \\nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . \\nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \\nif they eat tampopo\\'s ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \\nit\\'s pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \\n'\n",

      "b'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor\\'s effort . \\noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \\nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \\nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" \\nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison\\'s \\'the hurricane , \\' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . \\nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \\nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \\njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \\nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \\nthrough the efforts of that group and carter\\'s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \\nthe film details carter\\'s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \\nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \\ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \\nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \\nthe book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra\\'s eyes to the injustice that was carter\\'s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \\nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \\n \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . \\nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \\nit\\'s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \\nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \\nthe actor\\'s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\\'s length . \\nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \\nwashington\\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \\nhe doesn\\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \\nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \\nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \\n \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \\njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \\nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \\njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \\njewison\\'s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \\nsadly , though , the film\\'s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \\nthere is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \\ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \\ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . \\nthe canadians are good . \\nthe cops are bad . \\nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film\\'s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya\\'s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \\nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . \\nlove\\'s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \\nit\\'s too bad . \\nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \\ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he\\'s a racist pig . \" \\ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \\nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \\ncriticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \\nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \\nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \\nfurthermore , much of carter\\'s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \\nof course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don\\'t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . \\nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it\\'s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . \\ncarter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he\\'s not the only one . \\nwashington makes this film look good . \\ndenzel washington\\'s \" the hurricane . \" \\nsounds pretty good to me . \\n'\n",

      "b' \" snake eyes \" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \\nit\\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\\'s a great director and one who\\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \\nand it\\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \\nit\\'s worse than that . \\nit\\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \\nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \\nin certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\\'s classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \\nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \\nthere\\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \\nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \\nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \\ndiscovers there\\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \\nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\\' takes on what happened . \\nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \\nit takes one wrong step . \\nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \\nbut that\\'s not the worst part of it : it\\'s that it\\'s the one person you didn\\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \\nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\\'t rely on rick\\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \\nit\\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \\nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \\nthat\\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \\nthis time , it\\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \\ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \\nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \\nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \\nthen there\\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\\'s earlier \" carlito\\'s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \\nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \\nhe\\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\\'t so formulaic . \\na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \\nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \\nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \\nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\\'d be given , and perhaps he\\'d have to make a choice between who\\'s he has to believe . \\nnow there\\'s a film . \\nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \\n'\n",

      "b'underwater science fiction stays submerged \\nsphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \\none of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents . \\nyou keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered . \\npsychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash . \\nwhen he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years . \\nhaving written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship . \\nhis group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist . \\nunfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team . \\n \" after all , \" he explains , \" who reads government documents ? \" \\nlead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel . \\nonce there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo . \\ndiscovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere . \\nwhen adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds . \\na storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer . \\n \" my name is jerry . \\ni am happy \" flashes across the screen . \\nthis is unsettling for the psychologist . \\n \" what happens if jerry gets mad ? \" he asks . \\nbarnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can\\'t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . \\nthen the situation turns bad . \\ndeadly beasts appear from nowhere . \\na gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . \\nlethal sea snakes attack goodman . \\na giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" . \\nthe suspicious scientists turn against each other . \\nthis has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man\\'s science fiction film . \\nhowever even the finest ingredients don\\'t go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn\\'t seem to care about his product . \\ndirector barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn\\'t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . \\nthe first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . \\nit\\'s much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . \\nit doesn\\'t get any better when the action scenes begin . \\nwhile the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . \\noddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . \\nafter adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . \\ntheir history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . \\neven goodman and halperin\\'s ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing . \\nher psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing . \\nthere\\'s a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious . \\nwhen an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what\\'s going to happen . \\nthe movie affectations are nothing more than distracting . \\nchapter headings that divide the movie have no function . \\nthe shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos . \\nmuch of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow . \\nalthough some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn\\'t . \\neven a science fiction film must be internally consistent . \\nthere\\'s too much here that doesn\\'t make sense . \\nare the manifestations real ? \\nthe jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect . \\na scene in the sub suggests that it\\'s illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it\\'s not . \\nnot everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers . \\nwhere the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to . \\neven the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll . \\nthe climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale . \\nafter pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending . \\nit\\'s difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse . \\nfollowing the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours . \\nthe weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn\\'t have been much left . \\nthe movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there\\'s nothing special on the screen . \\nwe never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . \\nstealing from \" alien \" , \" the abyss \" and the disastrous \" event horizon \" , this film has learned nothing from them . \\nremarkably levinson and hoffman\\'s other currently showing film is \" wag the dog \" , a smart and entertaining piece of work . \\nthis one could have been titled the same sans one word . \\n'\n",
      "b'in the continuation of warner brother\\'s franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . \\nwhat makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . \\navika goldsman\\'s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . \\nthis coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as \" the client \" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . \\nsituations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . \\nthis is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone\\'s batgirl , who just happens to be alfred\\'s niece . \\nthe story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought . \\nwhile working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . \\nnow of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . \\nnow the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me . \\nif mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . \\nthis is indeed a cold hearted man . \\nthe development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . \\nshe wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . \\nshe joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them . \\nthe characters have no logic . \\nbatman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films . \\nnow that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any . \\ngeorge clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him . \\nto say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous . \\nhis best performances are still on \" e . r . \" . \\nbruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce\\'s latent homosexuality . \\nthere is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman\\'s psychologist in \" batman forever \" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred . \\nand even that relationship is very reserved . \\nrobin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series . \\nnow he\\'s just a spoiled kid . \\nin \" batman forever \" , burt ward wanted to be batman\\'s partner and friend . \\nnow , robin is suffering from ego deficiency . \\nrobin\\'s attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15 . \\nhis later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense . \\nchris o\\'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance . \\nhis robin needs nothing more than a good spanking . \\nthe less said about alicia silverstone\\'s performance the better . \\nthis talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film . \\nshe was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it . \\nthis brings us to the villains . \\narnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday . \\nthe most rediculous scene is during mr . freeze\\'s imprisonment . \\nthe guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film . \\nit\\'s almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member . \\numu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status . \\nher poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in \" sextette \" ( 1978 ) . \\nthe only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough . \\nthese two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film . \\nwithout going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first \" batman \" ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel . \\nmr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video . \\nevery villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume . \\nwith this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it\\'s tv incarnation . \\nthe only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , \\ngwaaaa\\'s , and clang\\'s associated with the old series . \\nyou almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film . \\nthe special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film . \\nand it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing . \\nevery set , from ivy\\'s lair , the batcave , to freeze\\'s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come . \\nthere is no one realistic set or set piece in the film . \\neverything is set for maximum exposure . \\nthe special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have . \\nthere are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on \" the time machine \" ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured . \\njoel schumacher has directed the film with no flair . \\ncamera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series . \\nmaster shots pepper the action scenes , destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had . \\nmr . schumacher is a good director . \\none just has to look back on the films \" the lost boys \" , \" cousins \" ( an underrated film ) and \" the client \" to know that . \\nbut \" batman and robin \" comes off as a mated made for tv movie . \\nthe film has no style of individuality . \\nit is the cinematic equivalent to jell-o , pretty to look at , but empty . \\nit is unfortunate that this film , even with it\\'s surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner\\'s thought tim burton would do with the franchise . \\nkill it . \\njoel schumacher\\'s \" batman &

      "b'for a movie about disco-era excess , \" 54 \" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club . \\nthink of it as a sort of \" boogie nights \" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , \" 54 \" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination . \\nit never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either . \\nin fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , \" 54 \" would be about as feathery as the time period\\'s popular female hairstyle . \\nstudio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 . \\ninside , anything went and , we are told , everything did . \\nthe film\\'s fictional main character is shane o\\'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club\\'s velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines . \\nhis wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in \\'79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course . \\nonce inside , shane becomes seduced by the club\\'s dizzying vortex of sex and drugs . \\nhe has such a good time that he doesn\\'t want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy . \\nhe quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg\\'s a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own . \\nafter rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 . \\nbut fame doesn\\'t come without a price . \\n \" 54 \" \\'s major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act . \\nalleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since \" 54 \" sometimes feels like it\\'s missing a scene here or there . \\nnowhere is this more apparent than in shane\\'s relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he\\'s long admired from afar . \\nthe romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special . \\nthat \" 54 \" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it\\'s assembled . \\nsure , it\\'s shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we\\'ve seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision . \\nthe film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( \" the wedding singer \" \\'s ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54\\'s closed doors and asks for a \" funky little treat . \" \\nthe solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you\\'re caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot . \\nnewcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it\\'s a shame their subplot goes nowhere . \\nmeyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in \" clueless \" ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , \" one , two , three , attitude ! \" \\nsherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big \\'70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left \" er \" as rubell\\'s accountant , but she\\'s criminally underused . \\nas the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone . \\nwhen he\\'s not playing the life of the party , the ex- \" saturday night live \" comedian strips away all of rubell\\'s confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it\\'s a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees . \\nand while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate \" austin powers \" -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with \" 54 \" \\'s overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball . \\n'\n",
      "b'if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? \\n \" gattaca \" is a film which presents a future where society has answered \" yes \" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . \\n \" gattaca \" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . \\nthe way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future \" gattaca \" presents becomes true . \\ncontrary to the misleading trailers , \" gattaca \" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there\\'s lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . \\nthis is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . \\nin fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who\\'s novel \" brave new world \" featured genetically engineered children ) . \\nit\\'s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what \" gattaca \" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . \\nthe story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . \\nas a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . \\nvincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it\\'s as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss !

      "b\"star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review \\na review by jamey hughton stars ) \\nstarring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g \\nwith all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film . \\nthe movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together . \\ncan george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ? \\nyes . this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity . \\nbut that doesn't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment . \\nthe phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history . \\nthe tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film . \\nthe vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding . \\nthe phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects . \\nafter we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan' . \\nthey are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo . \\noh , but enough about that . \\nthe prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture . \\nas you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader . \\na spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter . \\nthis particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you'll ever see . \\none of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception . \\ni loved sebulba , the rat-like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) . \\none character who has been subject to criticism is jar-jar binks , a member of the gungan race . \\njar-jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief . \\nyes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics . \\nthere is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses . \\nthe final light-saber battle , between the jedi's and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold . \\njabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances . \\nlucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness . \\none can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode's i and ii . \\nwhen they arrive , you'll know where to find me . \\n\"\n",

\\nwell , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he\\'s seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . \\nthey\\'re awful . \\nthese commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an \" action \" movie called detonator starring scott baio . \\nscott baio ! \\nwhat idiot dreamed this movie up ? \\nafter surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \\n \" maybe it won\\'t be * that * bad \" he may say to himself . \\n \" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . \\nwatchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . \\nit stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . \\nlou rawls is even in the mix ! \" \\nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \\nthe latter is really too bad . \\nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \\nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . \\npeople who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . \\nit\\'s definately not a koontz book if there isn\\'t ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people\\'s eyeballs . \\nwatchers has all three devices , which may explain why it\\'s arguably the most popular of koontz\\'s books . \\nthe idea behind koontz\\'s novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \\nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target\\'s position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . \\nsilly but kind of neat too . \\ni\\'m sorry . \\ni don\\'t mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . \\ni suppose i just don\\'t want to talk about the movie itself . \\nthis turkey is really cheesy . \\nno one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it\\'s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . \\nthe cheese factor is only increased when he\\'s involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she\\'s-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . \\nmercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . \\nto be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . \\nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . \\ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . \\nand the creature ! \\nyes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . \\nthis creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it\\'s okay . \\nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . \\noh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \\ncheesy gore . \\nthat\\'s another main element of watchers reborn . \\nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film\\'s campiness rather than its suspense . \\nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film\\'s silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it\\'s an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . \\nalso , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . \\nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . \\nfinally , i couldn\\'t help but think that watchers reborn would work well as \" bot fodder \" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , \" mystery science theater 3000 . \" \\nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . \\nrated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . \\nit also has violence , obviously . \\ni wouldn\\'t recommend it for the little kids , but i\\'m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . \\ninstead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz\\'s book . \\ntrust me , it\\'ll be time much , much better spent . \\n'\n",

      "b'i\\'ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . \\nthe part of jeff \" the dude \" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . \\nthe dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . \\nhe\\'s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . \\nafter much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . \\nthe dude assumes that these \" collection agents \" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . \\nthe millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . \\nhe wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . \\ndude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . \\ncomedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . \\nit is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . \\nnot only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . \\nall the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . \\neach person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . \\nthe characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . \\nit\\'s not what they do that\\'s funny , it\\'s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . \\nworth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that\\'s jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who\\'s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as \" vaginal ; \" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . \\naside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . \\npeople lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . \\nthey sound natural . \\ntaken with fargo , the coen brothers\\' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . \\nethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he\\'s also good at technical directing . \\nhe and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . \\nperhaps \" beautiful \" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . \\nbut the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . \\nall around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . \\noutstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . \\n'\n",

      "b'a new entry in the \" revisionist history \" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation\\'s biggest presidential scandal . \\nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene\\'s watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . \\nwhen they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . \\nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . \\nwhen they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . \\nduring a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president\\'s resignation . \\nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" deep throat \" . \\nfrom there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . \\nat one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . \\nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams \" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! \" \\nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . \\nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . \\nif this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it\\'s juvenile bathroom humor , but it\\'s not . \\nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience\\'s throat in the least subtle way possible . \\ni don\\'t recall oliver stone\\'s nixon having to pander to it\\'s audience , but of course that film wasn\\'t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . \\nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is it\\'s remarkable supporting cast . \\ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch\\'s woodward and bernstein . \\nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating . \\ni wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . \\ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch\\'s constant thwarting of ferrell\\'s attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy\\'s brother ) . \\nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . \\ni\\'d like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . \\nas for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . \\nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . \\nstay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . \\nan excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . \\nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . \\nas it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes . \\nand that , to me , does not make a funny movie . \\n[pg-13] \\n'\n",
      "b'the film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . \\nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . \\nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . \\nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . \\nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . \\nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . \\nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \\n \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . \\nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . \\nhowever , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . \\nanderson\\'s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . \\nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of \" magnolia\\'s \" scenes drag on too long . \\nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . \\nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn\\'t get boring . \\nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . \\nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . \\nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . \\nfor example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall\\'s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . \\nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . \\nanderson\\'s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . \\nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . \\nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . \\nthe performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . \\nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . \\nanderson allows many of hollywood\\'s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . \\nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . \\nworth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . \\nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon\\'s character as phillip baker hall\\'s wife . \\nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \\n \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . \\nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . \\nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . \\ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . \\ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future . \\n'\n",

and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \\ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \\nkasdan\\'s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \\nit\\'s the kind of humor that\\'s funny even after you\\'ve seen it five or six times . \\nthere\\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \\nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \\ni can\\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \\nas a side note , i don\\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \\nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \\ni have a feeling the humor here won\\'t appeal to everyone , but there\\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone\\'s interest . \\njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \\ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can\\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \\nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \\nzero effect is the kind of film that i\\'ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \\nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \\nand , with kasdan\\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \\n'\n",

      "b'teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . \\nevery year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand . \\nthe formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . \\nyou add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span . \\nthe response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due . \\nthat is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash . \\njosie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . \\nshe has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . \\nbut she is very much dismayed with her position in life . \\nthere is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . \\nso when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . \\nconstantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . \\nthe two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . \\nhowever , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . \\nobviously , the field assignment involves a high school . \\nspecifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and \" becoming one of them . \" \\ni don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t . \\nthe movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school . \\ninterwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again . \\nfortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting . \\nthey include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body . \\nalso , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative . \\nthe humor found in this film is actually quite amusing . \\ntypical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor . \\none scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical . \\nmost of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy . \\nbut those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie . \\nfollowing this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting . \\nit is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film . \\nin this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch . \\nshe is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions . \\nand although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . \\nat one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher . \\nbut she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance . \\nfollowing barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) . \\nshe seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic . \\nit is these \" qualities \" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent . \\nluckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film . \\ndavid arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined . \\nand as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . \\nin a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . \\nnever been kissed is a mediocre film at best . \\nthe predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . \\nthe acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . \\nunfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash . \\n'\n",
      "b'whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . \\nhe made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs . miller \" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \" popeye \" ( 1980 ) . \\nthe same holds true for his most recent film , \" the gingerbread man , \" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . \\nby the time \" the gingerbread man \" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . \\nthere\\'s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o\\'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn\\'t feature a great showdown in a courtroom . \\ninstead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \" the gingerbread man \" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman\\'s trademark full-frontal female nudity . \\nthe central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham\\'s other lawyer heroes . \\nhe is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . \\nrick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . \\na reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn\\'t hard to surmise that rick\\'s womanizing had a large part in it . \\nwhenever he\\'s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it\\'s because he\\'s been \" screwing around . \" \\nafter an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn\\'t lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . \\nhe drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . \\nrick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . \\nit was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \" weird \" stuff like that . \\nas another character puts it , dixon is \" a few beers short of six-pack . \" \\nrick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . \\nhe succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory\\'s begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . \\ndixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . \\nfrom there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . \\naltman\\'s cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . \\nif it isn\\'t night-time , at least it\\'s raining . \\ngu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . \\na great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . \\nin the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . \\naltman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \\nbut , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . \\n \" the gingerbread man \" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . \\nhowever , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . \\na great deal of the credit for the film\\'s success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . \\nhere , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . \\nrick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \\nwithout it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick\\'s pain and frustration . \\nthe supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) . \\ntom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . \\nit doesn\\'t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film\\'s one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \\nwhile \" the gingerbread man \" isn\\'t in league with altman\\'s greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \\nsome critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don\\'t make money . \\naltman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \\n'\n",

      "b\"the happy bastard's quick movie review \\nthe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . \\nshift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . \\nsadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . \\nsince the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem . \\nthe story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . \\nhis popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground . \\nthen , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . \\nthese two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . \\nforward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . \\nhowever , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm . \\nwith the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada . \\nof course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish . \\nthis leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . \\nfinally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . \\nthe main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny . \\nin fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . \\nbut that's just it- scenes . \\nthere's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . \\ni mean , was this really necessary ? \\ncouldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? \\ni mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? \\nparticularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? \\nthat really ruined it , however , and that's too bad . \\nthe acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting . \\nstill , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? \\nat least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked . \\n\"\n",

      "b'known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \\nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film\\'s two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \\nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today\\'s films as it is here . \\nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend\\'s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \\nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \\nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \\nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he\\'d rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \\njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \\nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \\nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \\nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \\nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \\nyou honestly don\\'t need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \\nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \\nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \\nyou\\'d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i\\'ve seen on film in the 1990\\'s . \\nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \\nplaying sex symbols throughout the \\'80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \\njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988\\'s well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989\\'s \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \\nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \\nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \\nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \\nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \\nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \\non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel\\'s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \\nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \\n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you\\'d expect , and wouldn\\'t have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \\nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \\nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian\\'s best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie\\'s overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \\n'\n",

      "b'alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . \\ni saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn\\'t like it . \\nof course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . \\nin order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . \\njames cameron\\'s aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . \\ni am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . \\nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . \\nboth are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . \\nas for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . \\nperhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . \\non the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn\\'t see . \\nit was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . \\ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong--i\\'m not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . \\nhowever , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . \\nas a result , alien 3\\'s only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . \\nwe never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . \\nthere were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . \\nthe other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . \\nalien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . \\nthe prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . \\nwithout using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . \\nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . \\nwe see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . \\n ( title ) . . . \\na shot of an alien egg . . . \\n ( title ) . . . \\nalien legs stretch up into the air . . . \\n ( title ) . . . \\nand so on and so on . \\nduring these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . \\nit\\'s quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . \\nbecause of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . \\nhowever , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . \\nunfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . \\nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . \\nof course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . \\nripley is revived and asks to see the ship . \\nafter seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . \\nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . \\nfeaturing a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog\\'s demise . \\nit\\'s one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . \\nand this is where alien 3 succeeds . \\nfincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . \\nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . \\nalien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . \\nby doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . \\nmany people have criticized fincher\\'s filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . \\nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . \\ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . \\nhowever , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn\\'t want to see die ) . \\nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don\\'t plan on spoiling that in this review . \\n>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . \\nin alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane\\'s stomach . \\nin aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . \\nalien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . \\nripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . \\nwhy it doesn\\'t kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . \\nfincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors\\' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors\\' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . \\nmany critics didn\\'t like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . \\nmost of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher\\'s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that\\'s not always a bad thing . \\nthe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . \\nagain , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . \\nhowever , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron\\'s film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . \\nas a result , no weapons are to be found . \\nthis creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . \\nas an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . \\nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . \\ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . \\ndespite this , ripley was the central figure , and that\\'s what is important . \\nwe care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . \\nagain , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . \\nwhile cameron\\'s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . \\nthe cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . \\nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . \\nthe yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . \\nshadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . \\nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . \\nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . \\nthe sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . \\nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . \\nthe sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . \\none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . \\nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . \\nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . \\nher reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . \\nit\\'s quite touching really . \\ncharles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . \\ncharles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately . \\nlance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but

      "b'star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \\nreview by matt pusateri \\nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\\' 1977 classic , star wars . \\nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \\narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \\nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \\ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \\nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \\nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \\nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \\nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \\nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \\nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \\nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \\nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \\nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \\non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \\nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \\nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \\ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \\nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \\nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \\nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \\nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \\nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \\none of the reasons the film\\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \\nit\\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \\nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \\nbut it\\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\\'s story or obi-wan\\'s . \\nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\\'s a shaky foundation . \\nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \\non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \\nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \\nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \\nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \\nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \\nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \\nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \\nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \\nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \\nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \\nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \\nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \\nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \\nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \\nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \\nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \\nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \\nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \\neach location is elaborate and complex . \\nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \\nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\\'t possible when the films were made . \\nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \\nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \\nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \\nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \\nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \\nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \\njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\\'s accidental sidekick . \\njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \\nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \\nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\\'t completely convincing . \\nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \\nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \\nyou accept that he\\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \\ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \\non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\\'t mind him at all . \\na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \\ndespite all the film\\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\\'s destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \\nfortunately , lucas hasn\\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \\nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \\nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \\nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \\nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \\nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \\nthe phantom menace won\\'t win any major oscars . \\nit probably won\\'t beat titanic\\'s box office record . \\nand it\\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \\nbut it\\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \\nthe film can\\'t live up to it\\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \\nbut it\\'s still worth seeing . . . \\nprobably more than once . \\n'\n",
      "b'david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . \\nwith his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . \\nsome of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . \\nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . \\noh , and it\\'s rated g . \\nincidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else\\'s work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . \\nhe casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . \\n \" did you do it ? \" he asks his boy . \\n \" no father , i didn\\'t , \" ronnie answers . \\nthat\\'s enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son\\'s case to court . \\nthey enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task . \\nit all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century . \\nbut arthur is determined to keep his family\\'s word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that . \\nsoon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings . \\nso do we . \\nall david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent . \\nthe characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense . \\nbut this is not mamet\\'s norm , and it\\'s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were . \\nnigel hawthorne\\'s performance is nearly flawless . \\nhis delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game . \\nwe pity the man , but we also like him . \\nrebecca pidgeon , david mamet\\'s wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur\\'s oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women\\'s suffrage movement . \\nthe winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one . \\nbe honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ? \\nif you wanted to but didn\\'t , this is a movie for you . \\nit is the epitome of subtlety : it\\'s powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing . \\ndavid mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too . \\nhe is almost a national treasure . \\nhis films deserve their own genre . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n'\n",

      "b'john sayles\\' \" men with guns \" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . \\nthe film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . \\nmost of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . \\nall people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . \\nhowever , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . \\nthere is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . \\nthe film\\'s main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . \\none of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . \\nfuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . \\nwith government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . \\nthis program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . \\nhowever , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . \\nas he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . \\nwhen dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we didn\\'t . \" \\nrational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others\\' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . \\ndr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . \\nfirst , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ?

      "b'a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . \\nit\\'s jeroen krabb ? \\'s melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can\\'t forget their bitter past . \\nthe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \\nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \\nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \\nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can\\'t locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \\nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents\\' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \\nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don\\'t go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \\nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn\\'t talk . \\nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \\nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn\\'t gone away there\\'s a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \\nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman\\'s book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \\nit starts off telling chaja\\'s story of how she\\'s a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can\\'t be forgotten . \\nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \\nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja\\'s parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \\nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \\ntopol\\'s reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \\nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can\\'t love : it starts out by showing how under chaja\\'s loving care he\\'s taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying \\'quack , quack\\' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \\nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy\\'s sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \\ni felt i didn\\'t just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \\nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \\nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \\nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \\nunless i was mistaken and the film\\'s real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \\n'\n",

      "b'it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . \\nwilde\\'s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . \\nthe glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . \\nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . \\nand that\\'s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . \\nit\\'s been said that todd haynes\\' \" velvet goldmine , \" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from \" citizen kane , \" and that\\'s true . \\nin the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . \\nstructure-wise , this totally steals from \" kane , \" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . \\nthis is no \" kane , \" and it really doesn\\'t aspire to be : it doesn\\'t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like \" kane \" did , and it doesn\\'t really uncover anything poignant about humanity . \\ninstead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . \\nthe 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . \\nbut the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . \\nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that\\'s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . \\ninstead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you\\'ve experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . \\nthere\\'s no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . \\nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . \\nblade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . \\nthrough discussions with slade\\'s ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . \\nhaynes demonstrates that he\\'s quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , \" baby\\'s on fire , \" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film\\'s most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . \\neven the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie\\'s , have a rare visual flair that\\'s pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . \\nthe best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . \\nin it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . \\nwith brian eno\\'s famous \" needle in the camel\\'s eye \" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn\\'t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . \\nit has a distance that\\'s hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . \\nthis movie\\'s not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being \" style over substance , \" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . \\nhowever , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . \\nthe music is especially notable . \\nthe soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade\\'s band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . \\nthe cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . \\nalthough eddie izzard , as slade\\'s manager ( who challenges slade\\'s first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . \\nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . \\nrhys meyers\\' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . \\nin fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . \\nbale\\'s character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he\\'s not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a \" poof \" ) never help us communicate with him . \\nnevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . \\nat the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . \\ntheir story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . \\nthe story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he\\'s the everyman , and when you can\\'t totally identify with the everyman , your story\\'s in slight trouble . \\nas a cultural rock piece , \" velvet goldmine \" is rather good , but it is merely good . \\nit never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . \\nit\\'s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . \\nthe beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . \\nand did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? \\nit almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . \\nstill , it does what the oliver stone pic \" the doors \" didn\\'t do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : \" live life , but after you\\'ve lived it , what else is the point when you\\'ll be forced to live with regretful memories ? \" ) . \\nthe really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down . \\n'\n",

      "b'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \\nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \\nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \\nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\\'s the x-files . \\nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \\nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \\nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \\nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \\nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\\'s representative to another species . \\nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \\nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \\nthe two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \\npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \\nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \\ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \\nthe film\\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \\nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \\nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i\\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \\ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \\ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\\' part more than anything else . \\nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \\neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \\ncontact doesn\\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \\nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \\n'\n",
      "b\"blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . \\nblade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . \\nit is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . \\nalthough , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . \\nthe ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . \\nbut at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . \\nthat really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . \\nblade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . \\nhis mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . \\nincluding a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . \\nblade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . \\nbut this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . \\nthe government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . \\nwhere do vampires get money ? \\nwell , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . \\ni personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . \\nblade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . \\nhe isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . \\nhe has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . \\nit's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire . \\nadmittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . \\nthe story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . \\nthe acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . \\nthis isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . \\nthe movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . \\nit's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . \\nblade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . \\nthe combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . \\nalthough , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . \\nblade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . \\nthis is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . \\nwhat blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . \\nvery cool . \\n\"\n",
      "b'when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be \" you too can believe whales can fly \" . \\nthen it was going to be \" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly \" . \\nthen , it was going to be \" you too can believe wood sprites can fly \" . \\nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \\nthere\\'s a lot of flying going on in this film ! \\nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \\nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \\npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \\nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \\nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \\nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \\nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \\nis the format effective for the film ? \\nwith a few exceptions , yes . \\nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\\'s fifth symphony . \\nit\\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \\neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \\neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \\nthough this segment isn\\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \\nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\\'s \" the pines of rome \" . \\nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \\na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \\nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . \\nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \\nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \\nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \\none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \\nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \\nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\\'s \" rhapsody in blue \" . \\nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \\nthere\\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \\ni won\\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \\nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \\nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\\'s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\\'s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . \\na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \\nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \\nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \\nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \\nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \\nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \\nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \\nset to camille saint-saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \\nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \\nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\\'s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer\\'s apprentice \" . \\nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \\nunfortunately , the segment wasn\\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \\nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \\nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \\nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\\'s \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \\ndonald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \\nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn\\'t make it on the boat . \\nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \\ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \\npowerful stuff . \\nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . \\nset to igor stravinsky\\'s \" the firebird \" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . \\ntrees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . \\nwhen the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . \\nin a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . \\nsome amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . \\nthe host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin\\'s clip is pretty funny . \\nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . \\npenn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \\nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \\npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner\\'s \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the \\'40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . \\nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . \\nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . \\nas i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . \\ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . \\nthen you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly . \\n[g] \\n'\n",
      "b'susan granger\\'s review of \" ghosts of mars \" ( sony pictures entertainment ) \\nhorror auteur john carpenter ( \" halloween , \" \" vampires \" ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that\\'s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . \\nthe script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year\\'s \" pitch black , \" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens . \\nin the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier . \\ngrier , pill-poppin\\' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch \" desolation \" williams - that\\'s ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder . \\nbut when they\\'re besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . \\nit seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as \" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , \" according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) . \\ncarpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the \" night of the living dead \" -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . \\nbut you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" ghosts of mars \" thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . \\nperhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet . \" \\n'\n",

      "b'a follow-up to disney\\'s live-action \" 101 dalmatians \" that\\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \\njust as unlikely . \\nwith \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \\n1996\\'s \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn\\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \\nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \\nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \\nbut that\\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\\'s laborious film . \\nwhat makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \\ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\\'t even aspire to that . \\nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\\'s split ends are more animated . \\nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\\'s in \" men of honor . \" \\njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu\\'s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \\nfrance\\'s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it\\'s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \\nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \\nthat done , it\\'s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \\nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that\\'s pretty much all they are . \\nthere\\'s always the feeling that there\\'s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \\nsavvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \\nit\\'s one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \\n'\n",

      "b'seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . \\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\nthere are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . \\nthey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . \\nwatching \" flubber \" really clinched this idea for me , because it\\'s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . \\nit proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . \\nthe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . \\nwe meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . \\nwithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . \\nphillip\\'s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer\\'s disease - isn\\'t this rather lowbrow comedy ? \\nhe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids\\' movie if i ever saw one ) . \\nwe learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he\\'s forgotten . \\nsara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she\\'ll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . \\nbut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it\\'s no surprise the major conflicts here are related . \\nchristopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip\\'s ideas , but his woman too . \\nwhat\\'s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! \\nwilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . \\none of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . \\nthe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . \\nit\\'s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . \\nunfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . \\nflubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . \\nmost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip\\'s absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . \\nbut it\\'s clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . \\nall the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don\\'t fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . \\nit\\'s all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . \\nduring the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , \" i think they might be cheating , \" to which the referee replies , \" there\\'s no rules about jumping too high . \" \\n \" predictable \" doesn\\'t begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . \\nand it\\'s not how terribly contrived the plot is , it\\'s the way it\\'s broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . \\nnot only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . \\ni\\'d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it\\'s almost forgivable when you realize they\\'re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . \\nit\\'s safe to say everything that could be bad about \" flubber \" is . \\nthe only original element the film has is the world\\'s first romance between a machine and a human . \\nbut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won\\'t . \\n'\n",
      "b\"earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . \\na real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . \\nnow , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . \\nthere's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing . \\nthe plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland . \\nned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . \\nenter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . \\nthe two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . \\nian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael . \\njackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . \\nthe two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience . \\nevery viewer is sure to like both of them . \\nthere are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . \\nthis appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary . \\noverall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . \\nthe ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout . \\nthe kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff . \\nin a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial . \\nit's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes . \\nthere's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . \\nindeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss . \\n\"\n",

' \\nno doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes . \\nthe major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination . \\nif it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced . \\nif it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull . \\ncompletely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) . \\ni am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents . \\nbeyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling . \\n\"\n",

' \\nalas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle . \\nthere are so many tired plot additions . \\ngadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l . \\nhughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian . \\nboth are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children . \\nwell , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) . \\nand don't even get me started about the villains . \\ni didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust . \\nthe characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . \\npenny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action . \\nthe special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over . \\nthe problem here lies solely in the script . \\nperhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . \\nhere is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway . \\n\"\n",
      "b'apparently , when crap calls , jim carrey answers . \\nhere he is , mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time , his second go-around in the role of pet detective ace ventura . \\nthat means more talking ass-cracks , penis jokes and cries of \" al-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lrighty then . \" \\nit all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler\\'s list in terms of dramatic merit , or lack of . \\ngranted , there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre-school humor , but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle . \\nit\\'s a painful experience for anyone with a brain . \\nace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a canyon ( in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone\\'s cliffhanger , jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect , or lack of ) and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness ( or , in his case , a level of consciousness ) . \\nbut he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of $20 , 000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe . \\nwhy africa ? \\nso carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino and later climb out the rear end as a tourist family watches ( \" look , the rhino\\'s about to give birth ! \" ) . \\nif that seems like hee-haw humor to you , by all means , see the movie . \\nif not , claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us . \\nobviously , there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie , like the first ace ventura film ( i use the word \" film \" only because it was filmed , not because there\\'s any level of artistic merit . ) , a huge success . \\nin fact , carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelligence in our culture . \\nyou may say to me , \" but andrew , look at jerry lewis . \\nhe was born with a negative i . q . \\nand look how popular he was thirty years ago . \" \\nmaybe , but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man\\'s testicles . . . \\nlewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over . \\n'\n",
      "b'one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , \" you\\'d better watch out for the skin deep . \" \\ni\\'d like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don\\'t watch skin deep . \\nskin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards . \\njohn ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem . \\ni never saw edwards\\' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake . \\nyou see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets . \\nas the movie opens , zach\\'s wife , alex , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress\\' hairdresser . \\nlike any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him . \\nin response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self-discovery . \\nif you\\'re turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley . \\nskin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters . \\nzach is a rich , \\'80s l . a . version of ritter\\'s jack tripper character from \" three\\'s company . \" \\nlike jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he\\'s the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye . \\nzach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . \\nconsequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . \\nin fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife\\'s wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony . \\nto add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work . \\nfor instance , vincent gardenia\\'s talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender . \\nof all the women in the film--and there are many--alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach\\'s wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role . \\nbecause we don\\'t care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film\\'s few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail . \\nthe comedy in skin deep doesn\\'t fare much better . \\nmost of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish . \\nabout every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of \" dueling \" condoms . \\noverall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat . \\nmy final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism . \\nzach\\'s excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain . \\nzach\\'s drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences . \\nif he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one . \\nif he gets arrested , his lawyer bails him out of jail . \\nif his wife leaves him , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he\\'ll clean up his act . \\nthe tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly , making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter . \\nperhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or , better yet , michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep . \\n'\n",
      "b'i\\'ll be the first to admit it . \\nwhen you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch . \\nyes , it\\'s a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . \\ncertainly , the experience wasn\\'t truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , \" i\\'m not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i\\'ll \\ngonna tell it the way i remember it . \" \\nanyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it\\'s trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations . \\ninstead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) . \\nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) . \\nthe setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s . \\nfinn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) . \\nduring one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) . \\nborrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro\\'s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor . \\nok . . . maybe \\nthat\\'s an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini\\'s records in the opening scenes of the film . \\nand that\\'s nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn\\'s motorboat , but i digress . \\nanyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he\\'s a really swell guy . \\nand then the plot moves on . \\nenter miss havisham . . . or \\nms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) . \\nabandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid . \\nwith bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role . \\nalthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film . \\njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) . \\nfor no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella . \\nperhaps it\\'s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before . \\nin any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn\\'t exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her . \\neven when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there\\'s nothing . \\nin fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear\\'s gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets . \\nat this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella\\'s character , and couldn\\'t care less about the two characters . \\nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow . \\nshe fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity . \\nthere\\'s obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you\\'re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character . \\nwithout a strong estella , finn\\'s obsession seems baseless . \\nyou wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life . \\nin fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot . \\nfinn\\'s relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical . \\nwhat\\'s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro . \\nalthough it\\'s only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create . \\nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film . \\nsome of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact . \\nfinn\\'s art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect . \\nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful . \\nas a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film . \\nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare\\'s romeo+juliet ) . \\nsimply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock . \\nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations . \\nas much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you\\'d probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film . \\n'\n",

      "b'from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . \\nhc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we\\'re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who\\'s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . \\nnice to see you , jim . \\nas a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? \\njb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . \\none entry was definitely enough , and i\\'m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . \\nit\\'s worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . \\ni should also mention that this movie likely won\\'t play all that well in cleveland . \\nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . \\nactually , most of the action involves the twins\\' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . \\nhc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . \\nleading off this inning is john warren . \\nhe steps into the batter\\'s box and takes kent\\'s pitch low for ball one . \\nwh : so , the story\\'s strictly minor league , right ? \\nwhat\\'s it about ? \\njb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . \\nwhen twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to \" the show . \" \\nwith the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . \\nin fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . \\nsoon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus\\' overachieving group against huff\\'s overpaid , last-place bunch . \\nwh : can we guess who wins ? \\njb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you\\'ve already seen the box score . \\non top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . \\nthey\\'re not just boring ; they\\'re lackluster . \\nbut the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they\\'ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . \\nhc : warren fouls off a fastball . \\n1 and 1 . \\nwh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? \\njb : not one , from start to finish . \\ni enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . \\nokay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . \\nthe two sequels haven\\'t just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . \\neven bob uecker\\'s once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they\\'re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . \\nhc : here\\'s the 1-1 pitch . \\nlooooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! \\nthe count goes to 1 and 2 . \\nwh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? \\njb : yes . \\nthere aren\\'t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . \\nbut i\\'d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . \\nheck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . \\nwh : it\\'s nice to see old friends one more time , isn\\'t it ? \\nlike cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . \\njb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . \\nthere aren\\'t any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . \\nyeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can\\'t throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? \\nthey have no depth . \\nnotable absences include tom berenger\\'s veteran and charlie sheen\\'s \" wild thing . \" \\nwe don\\'t really miss them , though . \\nhc : breaking ball , low and outside . \\n2 and 2 . \\nwh : so you\\'re saying that we should give this one a miss ?

      "b'>from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong . \\nat reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world . \\ncourtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school . \\neveryone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity . \\ncourtney is the \" leader \" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group . \\nit is liz\\'s seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz . \\njust like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else . \\nand also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don\\'t agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie . \\nand finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth . \\nthis time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney\\'s group , as well as the entire school . \\n>from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing . \\nnot only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast . \\njudy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has . \\nalso on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers . \\non the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn\\'t match her wickedly clever performance as \" tatum \" , in 1996\\'s scream . \\nmcgowan\\'s role is annoying , but this only adds to the film . \\nshe is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her . \\nfaring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles . \\nwhen the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles . \\ngayheart isn\\'t given as much to do here as she was in 1998\\'s urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker . \\njawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in . \\nwe get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don\\'t have anything to do with the actual film . \\nthe beginning and ending are strong , it\\'s just the middle that needs a lot of help . \\nduring the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion . \\nnothing to grab the viewer\\'s interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again . \\njawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat . \\nthe few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang . \\nall in all , a horrible disappointment . \\nthe bottom line : the tagline reads , \" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside . \" \\nyes , that is too true . \\nno matter how good this film may have looked , it fails to deliver . \\n'\n",

      "b'i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . \\nit\\'s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . \\ni sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . \\nin a word , it\\'s the same thing that\\'s wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . \\nmore to the point , it\\'s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you\\'re telling a story about a relationship . \\nthe bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we\\'re expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they\\'re attractive and pleasant . \\nin this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o\\'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . \\nit\\'s a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . \\nconvinced despite his reservations that it\\'s time to \" sh * t or get off the pot , \" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . \\nanne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . \\njimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . \\nthere are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy\\'s 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . \\nit\\'s a wacky , brewster\\'s millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film\\'s better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . \\nat least that would be the case if jimmy weren\\'t already a world-class altruist . \\nscreenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn\\'t get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . \\nfrom the outset , jimmy\\'s motivation isn\\'t cash ; it\\'s the livelihoods of his devoted employees . \\nit\\'s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor\\'s plot development . \\nby any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . \\nand that\\'s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . \\nthere\\'s never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there\\'s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . \\nthe blandly nice o\\'donnell couldn\\'t pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don\\'t even let him ; zellweger\\'s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . \\nand forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . \\nthe parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they\\'re all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . \\ni\\'ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov\\'s rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . \\nfar more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . \\nyou\\'re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that\\'s not the real problem . \\nnor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it\\'s leading up to . \\nthe problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there\\'s no spark , no energy , no humanity . \\nit\\'s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer\\'s digestions . \\nwe\\'ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don\\'t even have a pulse . \\nthe bachelor is love among the mannequins . \\n'\n",

      "b' \" well this is not mission : difficult , mr . hunt , it\\'s mission : impossible . \\ndifficult should be a walk in the park for you . \" \\n---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series\\' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch . \\na russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection . \\na rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) . \\nposing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do . \\nthe real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods . \\nethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose\\'s . \\nreluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team . \\nethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah . \\nalthough the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn\\'t much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) . \\nthat problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo . \\nthe end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while . \\nunfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah\\'s quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series . \\nethan\\'s conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) . \\njohn woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups . \\nthe surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film . \\nthankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah\\'s deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed . \\nrobert towne\\'s screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus . \\nafter that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo\\'s previous high-octane films . \\nthe final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) . \\nas far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare . \\nanyone looking for hardcore action won\\'t be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) . \\neven if you weren\\'t a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out . \\n[pg-13] \\n'\n",
      "b'i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco . \\nhowever , since i was 17 years old i\\'ve seen more than my share of adult films . \\ni mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i\\'m not against pornogrpahy . \\ni\\'ve seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available . \\ndirector paul thomas anderson\\'s boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s . \\nthis was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics . \\nthis was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story . \\none of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete . \\nin this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette . \\nburt reynold\\'s manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner . \\nhorner\\'s has a steady \" family \" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l . a . home . \\nbut in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better . \\nwhen horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . \\nit is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . \\nas directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . \\nboogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . \\'s hardcore film scene . \\nbut the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . \\nthe downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . \\nby the film\\'s final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . \\nboogie nights is not about sex . \\nit does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . \\nin fact , the film isn\\'t really about pornography at all . \\npornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . \\nthe film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . \\nyet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . \\nthe characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . \\nfirst stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . \\nsecond stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . \\nbut the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . \\neddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . \\nwith no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . \\nhis alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . \\nhorner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . \\nthe surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her \" babies \" provides some of the films most poignant scenes . \\nclearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . \\nbut the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . \\neven the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . \\nthen again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . \\neddie adams , who later takes on the screen name \" dirk diggler \" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . \\ni say \" former \" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . \\nthis is bold and brave territory for such a young man . \\nhe pulls it off marvelously . \\nwahlberg is a \" big , bright star \" with a big bright future . \\nboogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . \\nits intimate studies of character make it the superior film . \\nwahlberg\\'s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson\\'s . \\nbut in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . \\ni got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . \\nstill , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya \\nknow , kinda like disco . \\n'\n",

      "b'when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the \\'60s cartoon series of \" mr . magoo , \" special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay . \\nmr . \\nmagoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . \\nin fact , they were wrong . \\nmr . \\nmagoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it\\'s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . \\nit\\'s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . \\nlook at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you\\'ll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . \\nmagoo . \\nthe best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . \\nthe worst , mr . \\nmagoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . \\nthe first problem with mr . \\nmagoo is the script . \\ndespite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . \\nmagoo is comically barren . \\nfrom beginning to end , there\\'s not a laugh to be found . \\nevery attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . \\nyou\\'d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that\\'s not the case . \\ni\\'ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . \\nthen there\\'s leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . \\nin the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . \\nlately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . \\nmagoo . \\neven if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we\\'re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but \" top form \" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . \\nthis is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation . \\nthe story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . \\nthe cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . \\nthe bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . \\nmatt keeslar portrays one of magoo\\'s sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . \\nthe bumbling man\\'s other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . \\nmost of mr . \\nmagoo\\'s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . \\nthe cartoon violence level in this film doesn\\'t approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it\\'s still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . \\nthere\\'s a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean\\'s recent , similar misadventure , it doesn\\'t hold up well . \\nthen there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo\\'s near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . \\ni\\'m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . \\ntong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . \\nhis chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . \\nlike john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . \\nit is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . \\nmagoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . \\nthe screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn\\'t seem to be enjoying themselves . \\nwhen the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . \\nher pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . \\nmr . \\nmagoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen . \\n'\n",
      "b' \" there will be another , \" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? \\ntrue , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994\\'s the crow , anyway . \\nthe idea of spinning artist james o\\'barr\\'s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . \\ngiven that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . \\nof course , it doesn\\'t . \\nstubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee\\'s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . \\ni remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . \\nin flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . \\nit\\'s loud and repetitive , true , a sadist\\'s delight -- but it\\'s also horrifying and fascinating . \\ncity of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . \\nthere\\'s an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won\\'t be much of a success . \\nin fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . \\n ( i\\'ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) \\nso much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . \\nthis time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . \\nperez might have some screen presence if he\\'s given something to do with himself , but here he\\'s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . \\nat first , he\\'s shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . \\nhe\\'s befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . \\nkirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . \\ntattooed with angels\\' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . \\nthe gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . \\niggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . \\nlike all good things here , he\\'s dispatched too soon and without much imagination . \\nin the meantime , we\\'re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah\\'s compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren\\'t distinctly secondhand . \\neven the soundtrack is tired . \\nmore than anything i\\'ve seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it\\'s a movie with a lousy script but a great look . \\ncritics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn\\'t that bad per se . \\nhe\\'s got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . \\nhis major stylistic failing is that he can\\'t seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . \\nbut as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn\\'t , the performers who couldn\\'t , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . \\nwho bought david s . goyer\\'s anemic script , anyway ? \\nthe producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference . \\n'\n",
      "b'what a contrast ! \\nin the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . \\ni\\'m not sure you could get two more different movies . \\nwhile the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . \\nthis is one interesting movie . \\nit\\'s very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of \\'98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . \\nthere\\'s lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . \\nhurlyburly doens\\'t contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . \\nhis big question is : does it all pertain to him ? \\nand if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? \\n \" it \" means everything : television , friends , events that happen . \\ni guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what\\'s it all about ? \\nthis is not a movie for answers . \\ndonna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they\\'re not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . \\nthat\\'s what makes this movie stay on your mind . \\nthese are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . \\neven when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . \\nthe performances are all superb in hurlyburly . \\ni haven\\'t seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can\\'t remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . \\neddie isn\\'t a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . \\ni don\\'t want to be his friend but i\\'d like to help him . \\nchazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . \\ni\\'d never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . \\neveryone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . \\nit\\'s a nasty world ; it\\'s a sexist world . \\nunlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man\\'s world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . \\ni find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . \\nfirst , it\\'s depressing that such a world exists . \\na large part of hurlyburly\\'s success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . \\nsure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . \\nsecond , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men\\'s world . \\nwhere are the stories about women\\'s world ? \\nnot the soap operas and the \" chick flicks \" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . \\nhurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . \\nit\\'s very talkative , intelligent and static . \\nwhile this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they\\'re quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . \\nnot all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . \\nnot all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . \\nall it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . \\nit also means that you have to pay attention . \\n'\n",

      "b'seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] \\nmodern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . \\nthe biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . \\n \" your friends and neighbors \" takes a different approach as it\\'s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . \\none of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute\\'s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . \\nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . \\neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . \\nbut to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . \\nlabute\\'s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what\\'s specifically impressive is the fact the characters\\' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . \\nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . \\nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . \\nwe\\'re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone\\'s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . \\nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . \\nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . \\nwe\\'re simply dropped in on the characters\\' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . \\nthe characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they\\'re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \\nfirst there\\'s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don\\'t know what they\\'re problem is . \\nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn\\'t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \\nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn\\'t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \\nlabute\\'s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \\nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors\\' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \\nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \\ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \\nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \\nit\\'s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? \\nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? \\nlabute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it\\'s fascinating . \\ntwo other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . \\ncary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word \" bastard . \" \\nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he\\'s secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . \\npatric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . \\ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . \\nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . \\nshe\\'s a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . \\ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others\\' action , as that\\'s the hook of the film . \\nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and each\\'s scenarios , but it\\'s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . \\nthe result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . \\nfor a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character\\'s guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . \\none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . \\nsince the characters only interact with each other there isn\\'t much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . \\nare we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? \\ni don\\'t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . \\noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . \\nbut what this film does have that the others don\\'t is repercussions in the end . \\nalthough the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren\\'t immortal . \\nin what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . \\nit definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . \\nstill , it\\'s an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . \\n'\n",

predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . \\nit is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . \\nbut no one has arrived yet . \\nher 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . \\nsome of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . \\nbut they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . \\nthose who are invited are the ones that have the issues . \\nit is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . \\nfirst there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . \\nhe is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . \\nbridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . \\nthey stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . \\nhe is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . \\nhis lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . \\nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . \\nmoving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . \\nval is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . \\non the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . \\nparadoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . \\nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . \\nwisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . \\npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . \\nhowever , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . \\nfinally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . \\njack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . \\nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . \\nvery often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . \\nhowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . \\ninstead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . \\nfirst , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . \\nat other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . \\nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . \\nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . \\nand yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . \\nperhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . \\nbut it didn't happen that way . \\nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . \\n\"\n",
      "b' \" i\\'d rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , \" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher . \\nwith that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story . \\nhe will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation . \\nfrom elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church . \\nwell , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion . \\ninstead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god . \\nand arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments . \\ninstead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures . \\nwhen in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss \" sonny \" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson\\'s character crying out for her god in breaking the waves\\'s most powerful scene . \\nthe body of the story starts with sonny\\'s coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters . \\nwith his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident\\'s dying victims . \\nthe scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord\\'s work . \\nrobert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film\\'s director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier . \\nrarely has a movie been such a labor of love . \\nwith a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher . \\nduvall has every movement down pat . \\neven when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy . \\nhe dances and claps all the way . \\nsonny\\'s churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive . \\n \" i may be on the devil\\'s hit-list , but i\\'m on god\\'s mailing list , \" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent . \\nand they lap it up . \\npeople jump up , scream , \" praise the lord ! \" \\nand mean it . \\nthe intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable . \\nbut sonny is no saint . \\nit turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett . \\njessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church\\'s youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny\\'s church , leaving him unemployed . \\nsonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever . \\nthe bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( \" one way road to heaven : holiness temple \" ) with an enthusiastic flock . \\nin this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church . \\nhe asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money . \\nand his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks . \\na man who can\\'t stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , \" i quit school because i didn\\'t like recess . \" \\nin his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn\\'t seen in a while . \\nhis romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn\\'t follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies . \\nbilly bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker . \\nhis confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show\\'s many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take . \\nalthough it probably couldn\\'t have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely . \\nand don\\'t miss the sweet epilogue during the film\\'s closing credits . \\na tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film . \\nthe apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 . \\nit is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up . \\n'\n",

      "b'since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993\\'s steven spielberg drama \" schindler\\'s list \" and directed 1993\\'s intelligent \" searching for bobby fischer , \" his new film , \" a civil action , \" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career . \\nwhat doesn\\'t make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective . \\nthe film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama . \\nbased on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , \" a civil action \" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children\\'s death from leukemia due to unknown causes . \\njan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families\\' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city\\'s drinking water . \\nsuddenly , after hearing about the families\\' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out . \\nalso figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods\\' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case . \\ncoming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , \" a civil action \" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience . \\nperhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning . \\nwatching the film , i couldn\\'t help but notice its similarities with 1997\\'s far , far superior film \" the sweet hereafter , \" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children . \\nin his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home . \\nnot only was the plotting similar to \" a civil action , \" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes . \\nconsidering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful \" a sweet hereafter \" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm\\'s character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl . \\nin \" a civil action , \" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness . \\nwe do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters . \\nthrough its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta\\'s lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn\\'t appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job . \\nevery scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for . \\nyou\\'ve got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents\\' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what \" a civil action \" does . \\nto be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . \\naside from one flashback to when a man\\'s young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering . \\ni could say the performances were good , but who\\'s fooling who ? \\nsince every character is one-dimensionally written , no one\\'s acting abilities are challenged in any way . \\ntravolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that\\'s about all he does . \\nduvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets . \\nand what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture\\'s final scene , as a judge ? \\nshe appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ? \\nfinally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ?

      "b'with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft\\'s square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking . \\nno doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . \\nbut why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ? \\nobviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi . \\neverything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects . \\noverall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don\\'t sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling . \\nbut you won\\'t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , \" wow . . . \" \\nlike the series of games , final fantasy\\'s plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi . \\nit\\'s the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien \" phantoms . \" \\nwhenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . \\nwhile many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a \" zeus cannon , \" dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a \" wave \" using eight collected \" spirits \" to counteract the phantoms and kill them off . \\nwhile the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn\\'t . \\nit\\'s unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out . \\nperhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script . \\nsome could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay . \\nnevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes . \\nwhy do these aliens feed on souls ? \\nif they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ? \\nwhat is so special about the \" spirits \" that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ? \\nworse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who\\'s doing the talking . \\nfor the most part , it\\'s bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don\\'t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . \\nthe only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . \\nbut , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you\\'re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . \\nthere\\'s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . \\nyou\\'d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more . \\n'\n",

      "b'when quentin tarantino made \" pulp fiction \" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . \\nbut before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to \" citizen kane \" , hear me out . \\nmuch like \" citizen kane \" , \" pulp fiction \" has changed movie making forever . \\nbut i think the latter has had a tad more impact . \\n \" pulp fiction \" has actually ushered in a new era of film making . \\nit has altered the way films will be viewed . \\n \" fiction \" has spawned so many imitations , i\\'ve lost count . \\nsure , some have been excellent ( \" bound \" and \" the usual suspects \" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes \" pulp fiction \" as the original neo-noir of the 90s . \\nin this review , i hope to change all the people\\'s minds who have criticized it for it\\'s excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn\\'t really that graphic ) . \\nthe most brilliant aspect of tarantino\\'s masterpiece is the screenplay . \\nit is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the \" quarter pounder with cheese \" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn\\'t already . \\nthe story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine . \\nthe first , titled \" vincent vega and marcellus wallace\\'s wife \" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim\\'s . \\nthey talk for a while ( with the occasional \" uncomfortable silence \" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror . \\nafter giving marcellus\\' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a \" speech impediment \" . \\nthey also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic \" you never can tell \" . \\ni won\\'t reveal the rest of the story , but i\\'ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win . \\nthe second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the \" die hard \" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge . \\npreviously in the film ( like i said , it\\'s told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match . \\nas it turns out , he not only doesn\\'t take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent . \\nhe takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend\\'s apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence . \\non his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus . \\nthe two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous \" gimp \" scene , which is very reminicent of the \" squeal like a pig ! \" \\nscene from \" deliverance \" . \\nthe last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car . \\nthey seek help with a friend of jackson\\'s ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball . \\nthey end up calling a \" cleaner \" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . \\nin the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began . \\nif you haven\\'t already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition . \\nit features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen . \\nearlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago . \\nwhat the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable . \\nthat version cut out , like , half the movie . \\nwhat i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing . \\nfor instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses . \\nthis might help explain the divine intervention that takes place . \\njust a theory . . . \\none of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e . \\n \" psycho \" \" kiss me deadly \" , \" deliverance \" , etc . ) . \\nbut why shouldn\\'t he ? \\nit\\'s not like he out-right and blatantly stole . \\ngive the guy a break . \\nin case you haven\\'t already noticed , i believe \" pulp fiction \" is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as \" casablanca \" and \" the godfather \" ) . \\ntrust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s . \\nand besides , it\\'s one hell of a ride . \\nnote : if anyone knows how i could get a \" bad motherfucker \" wallet , please e-mail me . \\nany help would be greatly appreciated . \\n'\n",
      "b'as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . \\nwith the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a \" great \" piece of work and viceversa . \\nattempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . \\ni avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . \\nas the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . \\nas such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . \\ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . \\ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . \\nit is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . \\nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . \\nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . \\nit is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . \\nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . \\nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . \\nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . \\nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . \\nas in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . \\ndo not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . \\nfor those who are put off by the \" art \" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . \\nthere are no weak performances in this movie . \\nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . \\nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . \\nzhang ziyi is a budding superstar . \\nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . \\ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . \\nkudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . \\nang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . \\nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . \\ndon\\'t miss it . \\n'\n",

      "b\"all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . \\nand while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . \\namerican pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . \\ni must question the studio that releases a movie like this . \\nthe producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . \\nsome have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . \\namerican pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . \\nit is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . \\namerican pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . \\njim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . \\njim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . \\nof course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . \\nthere are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . \\namerican pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . \\ni loved the young cast in this movie . \\nconsider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . \\nbiggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . \\nbut in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . \\nscenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . \\nafter levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . \\nbut i never used baked goods . ' \\nit is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . \\nthere are some less-than-original aspects of the film . \\na bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . \\nif weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . \\nsecondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . \\nbut at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway .

he\\'s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \\nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady\\'s pants . \\nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \\ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \\nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it\\'s because i\\'m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas\\'s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \\nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \\nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i\\'m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \\nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \\ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \\nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \\nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . \\nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . \\nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \\ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \\nhe\\'s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \\nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \\ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \\nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that\\'s part of its charm . \\nand maybe i\\'m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i\\'m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \\neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \\ni\\'m privy to films about literary types i . e . \\nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \\nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \\nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that\\'s a problem i wish i found with films more often . \\nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \\nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \\nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \\nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn\\'t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \\ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin\\' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \\nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \\nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \\nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \\nit\\'s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \\nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \\n'\n",
      "b'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \\nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \\nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \\nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \\ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \\naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \\nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \\nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \\nin any case , the answer is no . \\ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \\nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \\ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \\neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \\ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \\nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \\nplease do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \\nyou have been warned . \\nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \\nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \\nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \\nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \\nwhen i compare it with last summer\\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \\nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \\nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \\nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \\nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \\nyou know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \\nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \\nand guess what ? \\nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \\ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \\nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \\nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \\nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \\nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \\nno , this is mulder\\'s time in the spotlight . \\nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \\nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \\nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \\ncares ! ? \\nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \\nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \\nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \\nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \\nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \\nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \\nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \\nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\\'t ! \\nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \\nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \\n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \\nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \\nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \\nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \\nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \\ncool effects ? \\nit\\'s good some . \\npulse pounding ? \\nhell yes ! \\nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \\nit does not provide answers to the show\\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \\nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \\nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \\nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \\nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \\nit\\'s pretty obvious the film\\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \\n'\n",
      "b' ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) \\nseven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . \\nit is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . \\nwhile this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . \\nfor starters , classifying seven as a \" thriller \" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . \\nwhile i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an \" intense drama , \" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . \\npart of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . \\nhe seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as \" simple \" as a corpse . \\nand visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin\\'s always-grisly special effects ) . \\nthrow in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . \\nthese scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . \\nyet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . \\nin addition to style , fincher supplies substance . \\nseven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . \\ndetective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . \\nits easy to see why . \\nthe world doesn\\'t make sense . \\n ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . \\nafter knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) \\nwhy should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and \" picking up the pieces \" he will be able to catch the killer ? \\nsomersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he\\'s naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . \\nhe completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . \\nhowever , david\\'s wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn\\'t even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . \\nthese three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . \\nand in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . \\nbut if there\\'s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . \\nseven\\'s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . \\none important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a \" psycho , \" with no motives behind his slayings . \\nthis is exactly the mistake mills makes . \\nin the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . \\nhe\\'s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . \\nin his mind he didn\\'t kill \" innocent \" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . \\nhes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . \\nreally , seven doesn\\'t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is . \\nseven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society\\'s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . \\nbesides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller . \\nit features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . \\nbut then again , its a cruel world . \\n'\n",
      "b\"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . \\nusually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . \\nto qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . \\nbut today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . \\nby the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . \\nnot in these times . \\nall you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . \\nwithout sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . \\nwhich brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . \\nnot only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . \\nwith all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . \\nyou also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . \\nblade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . \\nthe plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . \\nit's all hokum and nonsense , of course . \\nbut the filmmakers play it straight . \\nunfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . \\nyou know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . \\nanother tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . \\nalso it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . \\nhe must also be proficient in the martial arts . \\nwhy a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . \\n ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) \\nwesley snipes is buff as blade . \\nhe growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . \\nblade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . \\nthis dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . \\ntoday's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . \\nthey are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . \\nthey are more farcical than frightful . \\nthis whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . \\n\"\n",
      "b'under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . \\nhowever , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . \\neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . \\nthe movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm\\'s past patients . \\ndistraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . \\ncut to the \" next fall \" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn\\'t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . \\nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has \" the sixth sense \" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . \\nand this , as they say , is where the healing begins . \\nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert\\'s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of \" siskel and ebert \" ) . \\nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i\\'ve always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . \\nhere , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film\\'s conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i\\'ve fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . \\nand indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . \\nstripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . \\nafter seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . \\nit\\'s a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . \\nin fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . \\nand when the final moments do come , it\\'s a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . \\nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . \\ni won\\'t go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . \\nnow , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . \\nhowever , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few \" twilight zone \" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . \\nthe fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . \\nironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl\\'s funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . \\ni wouldn\\'t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn\\'t , by pure dumb luck , caught \" dateline nbc \" the other week when they did a feature story on it . \\ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn\\'t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . \\n'\n",

has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick . \\neight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight . \\nwhen odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , \" it\\'s all the same . \\nwherever we go , we\\'ll be in chinatown , \" and her straightforward statement expresses much . \\nthere is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends\\' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american . \\nboth their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong . \\nbut they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done . \\nsuch is life . \\nthe movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts . \\neverything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story . \\nslim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss . \\nthe exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people\\'s lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment . \\nyes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies . \\n'\n",
      "b\"this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . \\nelsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . \\ni am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . \\nif i had to list a reason why . . . . \\nbut that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . \\nadam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . \\nhe spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . \\none day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . \\nelsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . \\nmorse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . \\nso far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . \\ngood music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . \\nsuddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . \\nit appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . \\nuntil then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . \\nthe conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . \\nthe woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . \\nsomehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend . \\nfrankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . \\nafter this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . \\nif i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . \\nit might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it . \\ni don't . \\n . \\navoid . \\n\"\n",
      "b'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . \\nfrankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director\\'s greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . \\nunfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be \\'90s thriller . \\nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . \\nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what\\'s going on so that these flaws in logic don\\'t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . \\nunfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they\\'re happening . \\nthis is a very bad sign . \\nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . \\nof course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . \\na perfect murder isn\\'t a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott\\'s play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock\\'s version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . \\nemily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . \\ntheir marriage isn\\'t going well -- emily resents steven\\'s controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . \\nwhen steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn\\'t that of a typical cuckolded husband . \\ninstead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that\\'s too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven\\'s new york apartment and kill emily . \\n ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he\\'s supposed to get the rest . ) \\nultimately , i\\'m not sure which of the three main characters we\\'re supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . \\nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they\\'re not interesting . \\n ( it\\'s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn\\'t . ) \\nsteven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . \\nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . \\nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he\\'s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . \\ngwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . \\nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998\\'s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . \\nat least viggo mortensen ( g . i . \\njane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . \\nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of \" poirot , \" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily\\'s best friend . \\na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . \\nthere aren\\'t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . \\nit\\'s surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . \\nit\\'s just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . \\n'\n"
